eshonai had always told her sister that she was certain something wonderful lay over the next hill END_TOKEN
then one day , she’d crested a hill and found humans END_TOKEN
she’d always imagined humans—as sung of in the songs—as dark , formless monsters END_TOKEN
instead they were wonderful , bizarre creatures END_TOKEN
they spoke with no discernible rhythm END_TOKEN
they wore clothing more vibrant than carapace , but couldn’t grow their own armor END_TOKEN
they were so terrified of the storms that even when traveling they hid inside vehicles END_TOKEN
most remarkably , they had only one form END_TOKEN
she first assumed the humans must have forgotten their forms , much as the listeners once had END_TOKEN
that built an instant kinship between them END_TOKEN
now , over a year later , eshonai hummed to the rhythm of awe as she helped unload drums from the cart END_TOKEN
they’d traveled a great distance to see the human homeland , and each step had overwhelmed her further END_TOKEN
that experience culminated here , in this incredible city of kholinar and its magnificent palace END_TOKEN
this cavernous unloading dock on the western side of the palace was so large , two hundred listeners had packed in here after their first arrival , and still hadn’t filled the place END_TOKEN
indeed , most of the listeners couldn’t attend the feast upstairs—where the treaty between their two peoples was being witnessed—but the alethi had seen to their refreshment anyway , providing mountains of food and drink for the group down here END_TOKEN
she stepped out of the wagon , looking around the loading dock , humming to excitement END_TOKEN
when she’d told venli she was determined to map the world , she’d imagined a place of natural discovery END_TOKEN
canyons and hills , forests and laits overgrown with life END_TOKEN
yet all along , this had been out here END_TOKEN
when eshonai had first met the humans , she’d seen the little listeners they had with them END_TOKEN
a hapless tribe who were trapped in dullform END_TOKEN
eshonai had assumed the humans were taking care of the poor souls without songs END_TOKEN
oh , how innocent those first meetings had been END_TOKEN
those captive listeners had not been merely some small tribe , but instead representative of an enormous population END_TOKEN
and the humans had not been caring for them END_TOKEN
a group of these parshmen , as they were called , clustered around the outside of eshonai’s ring of workers END_TOKEN
they keep trying to help , gitgeth said to curiosity END_TOKEN
he shook his head , his beard sparkling with ruby gemstones that matched the prominent red colors of his skin END_TOKEN
the little rhythmless ones want to be near us END_TOKEN
they sense that something is wrong with their minds , i tell you END_TOKEN
eshonai handed him a drum from the back of the cart , then hummed to curiosity herself END_TOKEN
she hopped down and approached the group of parshmen END_TOKEN
you aren’t needed , she said to peace , spreading her hands END_TOKEN
we would prefer to handle our own drums END_TOKEN
the ones without songs looked at her with dull eyes END_TOKEN
go , she said to pleading , waving toward the nearby festivities , where listeners and human servants laughed together , despite the language barrier END_TOKEN
humans clapped along to listeners singing the old songs END_TOKEN
a few looked toward the singing and cocked their heads , but they didn’t move END_TOKEN
it won’t work , brianlia said to skepticism , resting her arms across a drum nearby END_TOKEN
they simply can’t imagine what it is to live END_TOKEN
they’re pieces of property , to be bought and sold END_TOKEN
what to make of this idea END_TOKEN
klade , one of the five , had gone to the slavers in kholinar and purchased a person to see if it truly was possible END_TOKEN
he hadn’t even bought a parshman ; there had been alethi for sale END_TOKEN
apparently the parshmen were expensive , and considered high - quality slaves END_TOKEN
the listeners had been told this , as if it were supposed to make them proud END_TOKEN
she hummed to curiosity and nodded to the side , looking toward the others END_TOKEN
gitgeth smiled and hummed to peace , waving for her to go END_TOKEN
everyone was used to eshonai wandering off in the middle of jobs END_TOKEN
it wasn’t that she was unreliable END_TOKEN
well , perhaps she was , but at least she was consistent END_TOKEN
regardless , she’d be wanted at the king’s celebration soon anyway ; she was one of the best among the listeners at the dull human tongue , which she’d taken to naturally END_TOKEN
it was an advantage that had earned her a place on this expedition , but it was also a problem END_TOKEN
speaking the human tongue made her important , and people who grew too important couldn’t be allowed to go off chasing the horizon END_TOKEN
she left the unloading bay and walked up the steps into the palace proper , trying to take in the ornamentation , the artistry , the sheer overwhelming wonder of the building END_TOKEN
people who were bought and sold maintained this place , but was that what freed the humans to create great works like the carvings on the pillars she passed , or the inlaid marble patterns on the floor END_TOKEN
she passed soldiers wearing their artificial carapace END_TOKEN
eshonai didn’t have armor of her own at the moment ; she wore workform instead of warform , as she liked its flexibility END_TOKEN
they hadn’t lost their forms as she’d first assumed ; they only had one END_TOKEN
forever in mateform , workform , and warform all at once END_TOKEN
and they wore their emotions on their faces far more than listeners END_TOKEN
oh , eshonai’s people would smile , laugh , cry END_TOKEN
the lower level of the palace was marked by broad hallways and galleries , lit by carefully cut gemstones that made light sparkle END_TOKEN
chandeliers hung above her , broken suns spraying light everywhere END_TOKEN
perhaps the plain appearance of the human bodies—with their bland skin that was various shades of tan—was another reason they sought to ornament everything , from their clothing to these pillars END_TOKEN
she thought , humming to appreciation END_TOKEN
if we knew the right form for creating art END_TOKEN
the upper floors of the palace were more like tunnels END_TOKEN
narrow stone corridors , rooms like bunkers dug into a mountainside END_TOKEN
she made her way toward the feast hall to check if she was needed , but stopped here and there to glance into rooms END_TOKEN
she’d been told she could wander as she pleased , that the palace was open to her save for areas with guards at the doors END_TOKEN
she passed a room with paintings on all the walls , then one with a bed and furniture END_TOKEN
another door revealed an indoor privy with running water , a marvel that she still didn’t understand END_TOKEN
she poked through a dozen rooms END_TOKEN
as long as she reached the king’s celebration in time for the music , klade and the others of the five wouldn’t complain END_TOKEN
they were as familiar with her ways as everyone else END_TOKEN
she was always wandering off , poking into things , peeking into doors END_TOKEN
eshonai froze , the door cracked open , allowing her to see into a lush room with a thick red rug and bookshelves lining the walls END_TOKEN
so much information just lying around , casually ignored END_TOKEN
more surprisingly , king gavilar himself stood pointing at something on a table , surrounded by five others : two officers , two women in long dresses , and one old man in robes END_TOKEN
why wasn’t gavilar at the feast END_TOKEN
why weren’t there guards at the door END_TOKEN
eshonai attuned anxiety and pulled back , but not before one of the women prodded gavilar and pointed toward eshonai END_TOKEN
anxiety pounding in her head , she pulled the door closed END_TOKEN
a moment later a tall man in uniform stepped out END_TOKEN
the king would like to see you , parshendi END_TOKEN
don’t be coy , the soldier said END_TOKEN
anxiety shaking her , she let him lead her into the den END_TOKEN
thank you , meridas , gavilar said END_TOKEN
leave us for a moment , all of you END_TOKEN
they filed out , leaving eshonai at the door attuning consolation and humming it loudly—even though the humans wouldn’t understand what it meant END_TOKEN
i have something to show you END_TOKEN
she stepped farther into the small , warm room , holding her arms tightly around her END_TOKEN
it was more than his alien , dead way of speaking END_TOKEN
more than the fact that she couldn’t anticipate what emotions might be swirling in there , as warform and mateform contested within him END_TOKEN
more than any human , this man baffled her END_TOKEN
why had he offered them such a favorable treaty END_TOKEN
at first it had seemed an accommodation between tribes END_TOKEN
that was before she’d come here , seen this city and the alethi armies END_TOKEN
her people had once possessed cities of their own , and armies to envy END_TOKEN
they knew that from the songs END_TOKEN
they were a fragment of a lost people END_TOKEN
traitors who had abandoned their gods to be free END_TOKEN
this man could have crushed the listeners END_TOKEN
they’d once assumed that their shards—weapons they had so far kept hidden from the humans—would be enough to protect them END_TOKEN
but she’d now seen over a dozen shardblades and suits of shardplate among the alethi END_TOKEN
why did he smile at her like that END_TOKEN
what was he hiding , by not singing to the rhythms to calm her END_TOKEN
sit , eshonai , the king said END_TOKEN
oh , don’t be frightened , little scout END_TOKEN
i’ve been wanting to speak to you END_TOKEN
your mastery of our language is unique END_TOKEN
she settled on a chair while gavilar reached down and removed something from a small satchel END_TOKEN
it glowed with red stormlight , a construction of gemstones and metal , crafted in a beautiful design END_TOKEN
do you know what this is END_TOKEN
he asked , gently pushing it toward her END_TOKEN
it’s what we call a fabrial , a device powered by stormlight END_TOKEN
just a smidge , unfortunately , but my wife is confident her scholars can create one that will heat a room END_TOKEN
no more smoky fires in hearths END_TOKEN
it seemed lifeless to eshonai , but she didn’t say so END_TOKEN
she hummed to praise so he’d feel happy telling her of this , and handed it back END_TOKEN
look closely , king gavilar said END_TOKEN
can you see what’s moving inside END_TOKEN
that is how the device works END_TOKEN
captive like in a gemheart , she thought , attuning awe END_TOKEN
they’ve built devices that mimic how we apply the forms END_TOKEN
the humans did so much with their limitations END_TOKEN
the chasmfiends aren’t your gods , are they , he said END_TOKEN
what a strange turn in the conversation END_TOKEN
oh , it’s merely something i’ve been thinking about END_TOKEN
my officers feel so superior , as they think they have you figured out END_TOKEN
they think you’re savages , but they are so wrong END_TOKEN
he leaned forward , the light from the ruby leaking between his fingers END_TOKEN
i need you to deliver a message to your leaders END_TOKEN
you’re close to them , and i’m being watched END_TOKEN
i need their help to achieve something END_TOKEN
now , now , he said END_TOKEN
i’m going to help you , eshonai END_TOKEN
did you know , i’ve discovered how to bring your gods back END_TOKEN
she hummed to the rhythm of the terrors END_TOKEN
my ancestors , he said , holding up the fabrial , first learned how to hold a spren inside a gemstone END_TOKEN
and with a very special gemstone , you can hold even a god END_TOKEN
your majesty , she said , daring to take his hand in hers END_TOKEN
we no longer worship those gods END_TOKEN
we left them , abandoned them END_TOKEN
ah , but this is for your good , and for ours END_TOKEN
we live without honor , for your gods once brought ours END_TOKEN
without them , we have no power END_TOKEN
this world is trapped , eshonai END_TOKEN
stuck in a dull , lifeless state of transition END_TOKEN
our enslaved parshmen were once like you END_TOKEN
then we somehow robbed them of their ability to undergo the transformation END_TOKEN
we did it by capturing a spren END_TOKEN
he looked at her , green eyes alight END_TOKEN
i’ve seen how that can be reversed END_TOKEN
a new storm that will bring the heralds out of hiding END_TOKEN
our gods tried to destroy you END_TOKEN
the old words must be spoken again END_TOKEN
she trailed off , noticing for the first time that a map covered the table nearby END_TOKEN
expansive , it showed a land bounded by oceans— and the artistry of it put her own attempts to shame END_TOKEN
she rose and stepped to the table , gaping , the rhythm of awe playing in her mind END_TOKEN
even the grand chandeliers and carved walls were nothing by comparison END_TOKEN
this was knowledge and beauty , fused into one END_TOKEN
i thought you’d be pleased to hear that we are allies in seeking the return of your gods , gavilar said END_TOKEN
she could almost hear the rhythm of reprimand in his dead words END_TOKEN
you claim to fear them , but why fear that which made you live END_TOKEN
my people need to be united , and i need an empire that won’t simply turn to infighting once i am gone END_TOKEN
i seek for an end to something that we never finished END_TOKEN
my people were radiant once , and your people—the parshmen—were vibrant END_TOKEN
who is served by this drab world where my people fight each other in endless squabbles , without light to guide them , and your people are as good as corpses END_TOKEN
she looked back at the map END_TOKEN
that is all of natanatan you gesture toward , eshonai END_TOKEN
he pointed at a spot not much bigger than his thumbnail , when the entire map was as large as the table END_TOKEN
it gave her a sudden dizzying perspective END_TOKEN
she’d assumed that in traveling to kholinar , they’d crossed almost as far as the land could go END_TOKEN
why hadn’t they shown her this before END_TOKEN
her legs weakened , and she attuned mourning END_TOKEN
she dropped back into her seat , unable to stand END_TOKEN
gavilar removed something from his pocket END_TOKEN
it was dark , yet somehow still glowed END_TOKEN
an aura of blackness , a phantom light that was not light END_TOKEN
it seemed to suck in the light around it END_TOKEN
he set it on the table before her END_TOKEN
take that to the five and explain what i told you END_TOKEN
tell them to remember what your people once were END_TOKEN
he patted her on the shoulder , then left the room END_TOKEN
she stared at that terrible light , and—from the songs—knew it for what it was END_TOKEN
the forms of power had been associated with a dark light , a light from the king of gods END_TOKEN
she plucked the sphere off the table and went running END_TOKEN
when the drums were set up , eshonai insisted on joining the drummers END_TOKEN
she beat to the rhythm in her head , banging as hard as she could , trying with each beat to banish the things the king had said END_TOKEN
and the things she’d just done END_TOKEN
the five sat at the high table , the remnants of their final course uneaten END_TOKEN
he intends to bring back our gods , she’d told the five END_TOKEN
furious beats pulsing through her soul END_TOKEN
klade claimed that a voice—speaking to the rhythms—had led him to the man , who had confessed his skills when pressed END_TOKEN
venli had apparently been with klade , though eshonai hadn’t seen her sister since earlier in the day END_TOKEN
after a frantic debate , the five had agreed this was a sign of what they were to do END_TOKEN
long ago , the listeners had summoned the courage to adopt dullform in order to escape their gods END_TOKEN
they’d sought freedom at any cost END_TOKEN
today , the cost of maintaining that freedom would be high END_TOKEN
she wept softly , and didn’t look as the strange assassin—wearing flowing white clothing provided by klade—left the room END_TOKEN
she’d voted with the others for this course of action END_TOKEN
feel the peace of the music END_TOKEN
she resisted as the others pulled her away END_TOKEN
she wept to leave the music behind END_TOKEN
wept for her people , who might be destroyed for tonight’s action END_TOKEN
wept for the world , which might never know what the listeners had done for it END_TOKEN
wept for the king , whom she had consigned to death END_TOKEN
the drums cut off around her , and dying music echoed through the halls END_TOKEN
i’m certain some will feel threatened by this record END_TOKEN
most will simply feel that it should not exist END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin appeared in the vision standing beside the memory of a dead god END_TOKEN
it had been six days since his forces had arrived at urithiru , legendary holy tower city of the knights radiant END_TOKEN
they had escaped the arrival of a new devastating storm , seeking refuge through an ancient portal END_TOKEN
they were settling into their new home hidden in the mountains END_TOKEN
and yet , dalinar felt as if he knew nothing END_TOKEN
he didn’t understand the force he fought , let alone how to defeat it END_TOKEN
he barely understood the storm , and what it meant in returning the voidbringers , ancient enemies of men END_TOKEN
so he came here , into his visions END_TOKEN
seeking to pull secrets from the god—named honor , or the almighty—who had left them END_TOKEN
this particular vision was the first that dalinar had ever experienced END_TOKEN
it began with him standing next to an image of the god in human form , both perched atop a cliff overlooking kholinar : dalinar’s home , seat of the government END_TOKEN
in the vision , the city had been destroyed by some unknown force END_TOKEN
the almighty started speaking , but dalinar ignored him END_TOKEN
dalinar had become a knight radiant by bonding the stormfather himself—soul of the highstorm , most powerful spren on roshar—and dalinar had discovered he could now have these visions replayed for him at will END_TOKEN
he’d already heard this monologue three times , and had repeated it word for word to navani for transcription END_TOKEN
this time , dalinar instead walked to the edge of the cliff and knelt to look out upon the ruins of kholinar END_TOKEN
the air smelled dry here , dusty and warm END_TOKEN
he squinted , trying to extract some meaningful detail from the chaos of broken buildings END_TOKEN
even the windblades—once magnificent , sleek rock formations exposing countless strata and variations—had been shattered END_TOKEN
these visions were like a diary , a set of immersive messages the god had left behind END_TOKEN
dalinar appreciated the help , but right now he wanted details END_TOKEN
he searched the sky and discovered a ripple in the air , like heat rising from distant stone END_TOKEN
a shimmer the size of a building END_TOKEN
can you take me down below , into the rubble END_TOKEN
you are not supposed to go there END_TOKEN
that is not part of the vision END_TOKEN
ignore what i’m supposed to do , for the moment , dalinar said END_TOKEN
can you transport me to those ruins END_TOKEN
he was a strange being , somehow connected to the dead god , but not exactly the same thing as the almighty END_TOKEN
at least today he wasn’t using a voice that rattled dalinar’s bones END_TOKEN
in an eyeblink , dalinar was transported END_TOKEN
he no longer stood atop the cliff , but was on the plains down before the ruins of the city END_TOKEN
thank you , dalinar said , striding the short remaining distance to the ruins END_TOKEN
only six days had passed since their discovery of urithiru END_TOKEN
six days since the awakening of the parshendi , who had gained strange powers and glowing red eyes END_TOKEN
six days since the arrival of the new storm—the everstorm , a tempest of dark thunderheads and red lightning END_TOKEN
some in his armies thought that it was finished , the storm over as one catastrophic event END_TOKEN
the everstorm would return , and would soon hit shinovar in the far west END_TOKEN
following that , it would course across the land END_TOKEN
monarchs in places like azir and thaylenah admitted that a strange storm had appeared in the east , but they didn’t believe it would return END_TOKEN
they couldn’t guess how destructive this storm’s return would be END_TOKEN
when it had first appeared , it had clashed with the highstorm , creating a unique cataclysm END_TOKEN
hopefully it would not be as bad on its own—but it would still be a storm blowing the wrong way END_TOKEN
and it would awaken the world’s parshman servants and make them into voidbringers END_TOKEN
what do you expect to learn END_TOKEN
the stormfather said as dalinar reached the rubble of the city END_TOKEN
this vision was constructed to draw you to the ridge to speak with honor END_TOKEN
the rest is backdrop , a painting END_TOKEN
honor put this rubble here , dalinar said , waving toward the broken walls heaped before him END_TOKEN
backdrop or not , his knowledge of the world and our enemy couldn’t help but affect the way he made this vision END_TOKEN
dalinar hiked up the rubble of the outer walls END_TOKEN
kholinar had been… storm it , kholinar was END_TOKEN
a grand city , like few in the world END_TOKEN
instead of hiding in the shadow of a cliff or inside a sheltered chasm , kholinar trusted in its enormous walls to buffer it from highstorm winds END_TOKEN
it defied the winds , and did not bow to the storms END_TOKEN
in this vision , something had destroyed it anyway END_TOKEN
dalinar crested the detritus and surveyed the area , trying to imagine how it had felt to settle here so many millennia ago END_TOKEN
back when there had been no walls END_TOKEN
it had been a hardy , stubborn lot who had grown this place END_TOKEN
he saw scrapes and gouges on the stones of the fallen walls , like those made by a predator in the flesh of its prey END_TOKEN
the windblades had been smashed , and from up close he could see claw marks on one of those as well END_TOKEN
i’ve seen creatures that could do this , he said , kneeling beside one of the stones , feeling the rough gash in the granite surface END_TOKEN
in my visions , i witnessed a stone monster that ripped itself free of the underlying rock END_TOKEN
there are no corpses , but that’s probably because the almighty didn’t populate the city in this vision END_TOKEN
he just wanted a symbol of the coming destruction END_TOKEN
he didn’t think kholinar would fall to the everstorm , but to the voidbringers END_TOKEN
the storm will be a catastrophe , but not nearly on the scale of what follows END_TOKEN
you can find refuge from storms , son of honor END_TOKEN
now that the monarchs of roshar had refused to listen to dalinar’s warning that the everstorm would soon strike them , what else could dalinar do END_TOKEN
the real kholinar was reportedly consumed by riots—and the queen had gone silent END_TOKEN
dalinar’s armies had limped away from their first confrontation with the voidbringers , and even many of his own highprinces hadn’t joined him in that battle END_TOKEN
in awakening the desolation , the enemy had rekindled a millennia - old conflict of ancient creatures with inscrutable motivations and unknown powers END_TOKEN
heralds were supposed to appear and lead the charge against the voidbringers END_TOKEN
the knights radiant should have already been in place , prepared and trained , ready to face the enemy END_TOKEN
they were supposed to be able to trust in the guidance of the almighty END_TOKEN
instead , dalinar had only a handful of new radiants , and there was no sign of help from the heralds END_TOKEN
and beyond that , the almighty—god himself—was dead END_TOKEN
somehow , dalinar was supposed to save the world anyway END_TOKEN
the ground started to tremble ; the vision was ending with the land falling away END_TOKEN
atop the cliff , the almighty would have just concluded his speech END_TOKEN
a final wave of destruction rolled across the land like a highstorm END_TOKEN
a metaphor designed by the almighty to represent the darkness and devastation that was coming upon humankind END_TOKEN
your legends say that you won , he had said END_TOKEN
but the truth is that we lost END_TOKEN
no , dalinar said , standing atop the rubble END_TOKEN
the wave of destruction struck , crashing against dalinar , and he shouted defiance END_TOKEN
he had not bowed before the highstorm ; he would not bow before this END_TOKEN
he faced it head - on , and in the blast of power that ripped apart the ground , he saw something END_TOKEN
a golden light , brilliant yet terrible END_TOKEN
standing before it , a dark figure in black shardplate END_TOKEN
the figure had nine shadows , each spreading out in a different direction , and its eyes glowed a brilliant red END_TOKEN
dalinar stared deep into those eyes , and felt a chill wash through him END_TOKEN
though the destruction raged around him , vaporizing rocks , those eyes frightened him more END_TOKEN
he saw something terribly familiar in them END_TOKEN
this was a danger far beyond even the storms END_TOKEN
dalinar gasped as the vision shattered END_TOKEN
he found himself sitting beside navani in a quiet stone room in the tower city of urithiru END_TOKEN
dalinar didn’t need to be bound for visions any longer ; he had enough control over them that he had ceased acting them out while experiencing them END_TOKEN
he breathed deeply , sweat trickling down his face , his heart racing END_TOKEN
navani said something , but for the moment he couldn’t hear her END_TOKEN
she seemed distant compared to the rushing in his ears END_TOKEN
what was that light i saw END_TOKEN
i saw no light , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
it was brilliant and golden , but terrible , dalinar whispered END_TOKEN
it bathed everything in its heat END_TOKEN
the god who had killed the almighty END_TOKEN
nine shadows , dalinar whispered , trembling END_TOKEN
dalinar knew of them from legend only END_TOKEN
terrible spren who twisted the minds of men END_TOKEN
still , those eyes haunted him END_TOKEN
as frightening as it was to contemplate the unmade , he feared that figure with the red eyes the most END_TOKEN
dalinar blinked , looking to navani , the woman he loved , her face painfully concerned as she held his arm END_TOKEN
in this strange place and stranger time , she was something real END_TOKEN
a mature beauty—in some ways the picture of a perfect vorin woman : lush lips , light violet eyes , silvering black hair in perfect braids , curves accentuated by the tight silk havah END_TOKEN
no man would ever accuse navani of being scrawny END_TOKEN
i’m… he drew in a deep breath END_TOKEN
and i know what we must do END_TOKEN
i have to unite the world against the enemy faster than he can destroy it END_TOKEN
he had to find a way to make the other monarchs of the world listen to him END_TOKEN
he had to prepare them for the new storm and the voidbringers END_TOKEN
and , barring that , he had to help them survive the effects END_TOKEN
but if he succeeded , he wouldn’t have to face the desolation alone END_TOKEN
this was not a matter of one nation against the voidbringers END_TOKEN
he needed the kingdoms of the world to join him , and he needed to find the knights radiant who were being created among their populations END_TOKEN
dalinar , she said , i think that’s a worthy goal… but storms , what of ourselves END_TOKEN
this mountainside is a wasteland—what are we going to feed our armies END_TOKEN
will run out of gemstones eventually , navani said END_TOKEN
and they can create only the basic necessities END_TOKEN
dalinar , we’re half frozen up here , broken and divided END_TOKEN
our command structure is in disarray , and it—
peace , navani , dalinar said , rising END_TOKEN
he pulled her to her feet END_TOKEN
he held to her , feeling her warmth , smelling her perfume END_TOKEN
she preferred a less floral scent than other women—a fragrance with spice to it , like the aroma of newly cut wood END_TOKEN
we can do this , he told her END_TOKEN
together , we will convince the other kingdoms to join with us END_TOKEN
they’ll see when the storm returns that our warnings were right , and they’ll unite against the enemy END_TOKEN
we can use the oathgates to move troops and to support each other END_TOKEN
ten portals , ancient fabrials , were gateways to urithiru END_TOKEN
when a knight radiant activated one of the devices , those people standing upon its surrounding platform were brought to urithiru , appearing on a similar device here at the tower END_TOKEN
they only had one pair of oathgates active now—the ones that moved people back and forth between urithiru and the shattered plains END_TOKEN
nine more could theoretically be made to work—but unfortunately , their research determined that a mechanism inside each of them had to be unlocked from both sides before they’d work END_TOKEN
if he wanted to travel to vedenar , thaylen city , azimir , or any of the other locations , they’d first need to get one of their radiants to the city and unlock the device END_TOKEN
somehow we’ll make them listen—even if they’ve got their fingers planted firmly in their ears END_TOKEN
makes one wonder how they manage it , with their heads rammed up their own backsides END_TOKEN
he smiled , and suddenly thought himself foolish for idealizing her just earlier END_TOKEN
navani kholin was not some timid , perfect ideal—she was a sour storm of a woman , set in her ways , stubborn as a boulder rolling down a mountain and increasingly impatient with things she considered foolish END_TOKEN
he loved her the most for that END_TOKEN
for being open and genuine in a society that prided itself on secrets END_TOKEN
she’d been breaking taboos , and hearts , since their youth END_TOKEN
at times , the idea that she loved him back seemed as surreal as one of his visions END_TOKEN
a knock came at the door to his room , and navani called for the person to enter END_TOKEN
one of dalinar’s scouts poked her head in through the door END_TOKEN
dalinar turned , frowning , noting the woman’s nervous posture and quick breathing END_TOKEN
sir , the woman said , saluting , face pale END_TOKEN
a corpse discovered in the corridors END_TOKEN
dalinar felt something building , an energy in the air like the sensation of lightning about to strike END_TOKEN
highprince torol sadeas , sir , the woman said END_TOKEN
i needed to write it anyway END_TOKEN
what do you think you’re doing END_TOKEN
adolin kholin strode over to a group of workers in crem - stained work outfits who were unloading boxes from the back of a wagon END_TOKEN
their chull twisted , trying to search out rockbuds to munch on END_TOKEN
they were deep within the tower , for all the fact that this cavern was as large as a small town END_TOKEN
the workers had the decency to look chagrined , though they probably didn’t know what for END_TOKEN
a flock of scribes trailing adolin checked the contents of the wagon END_TOKEN
oil lamps on the ground did little to push back the darkness of the enormous room , which had a ceiling that went up four stories END_TOKEN
one of the workers asked , scratching at his hair beneath his cap END_TOKEN
that’s what i think i was doin’ END_TOKEN
manifest says beer , rushu—a young ardent—told adolin END_TOKEN
section two , adolin said , rapping the knuckles of his left hand against the wagon END_TOKEN
taverns are being set up along the central corridor with the lifts , six crossroads inward END_TOKEN
my aunt expressly told your highlords this END_TOKEN
the men just stared at him blankly END_TOKEN
i can have a scribe show you END_TOKEN
the men sighed , but started reloading their wagon END_TOKEN
they knew better than to argue with the son of a highprince END_TOKEN
adolin turned to survey the deep cavern , which had become a dumping ground for both supplies and people END_TOKEN
women gathered water at the well in the center END_TOKEN
even axehounds raced this way and that END_TOKEN
four entire warcamps full of people had frantically crossed the shattered plains to urithiru , and navani had struggled to find the right spot for them all END_TOKEN
for all the chaos , though , adolin was glad to have these people END_TOKEN
they were fresh ; they hadn’t suffered the battle with the parshendi , the attack of the assassin in white , and the terrible clash of two storms END_TOKEN
the kholin soldiers were in terrible shape END_TOKEN
adolin’s own sword hand was wrapped and still throbbing , his wrist broken during the fighting END_TOKEN
his face had a nasty bruise , and he was one of the more lucky ones END_TOKEN
brightlord , rushu said , pointing at another wagon END_TOKEN
was nobody paying attention to aunt navani’s directives END_TOKEN
he dealt with this wagon , then had to break up an argument among men who were angry they had been set to hauling water END_TOKEN
they claimed that was parshman work , beneath their nahn END_TOKEN
unfortunately , there were no parshmen any longer END_TOKEN
adolin soothed them and suggested they could start a water haulers’ guild if forced to continue END_TOKEN
father would approve that for certain , though adolin worried END_TOKEN
would they have the funds to pay all these people END_TOKEN
wages were based on a man’s rank , and you couldn’t just make slaves of men for no reason END_TOKEN
adolin was glad for the assignment , to distract him END_TOKEN
though he didn’t have to see to each wagon himself—he was here to supervise—he threw himself into the details of the work END_TOKEN
he couldn’t exactly spar , not with his wrist in this shape , but if he sat alone too long he started thinking about what had happened the day before END_TOKEN
had he really murdered torol sadeas END_TOKEN
it was almost a relief when at long last a runner came for him , whispering that something had been discovered in the corridors of the third floor END_TOKEN
adolin was certain he knew what it was END_TOKEN
dalinar heard the shouts long before he arrived END_TOKEN
he left navani and broke into a run , sweating as he burst into a wide intersection between tunnels END_TOKEN
men in blue , lit by the harsh light of lanterns , faced off against others in forest green END_TOKEN
angerspren grew from the floor like pools of blood END_TOKEN
a corpse with a green jacket draped over the face lay on the ground END_TOKEN
dalinar bellowed , charging into the space between the two groups of soldiers END_TOKEN
he pulled back a bridgeman who had gotten right up in the face of one of sadeas’s soldiers END_TOKEN
stand down , or i’ll have you all in the stockade , every man END_TOKEN
his voice hit the men like stormwinds , drawing eyes from both sides END_TOKEN
he pushed the bridgeman toward his fellows , then shoved back one of sadeas’s soldiers , praying the man would have the presence of mind to resist attacking a highprince END_TOKEN
navani and the scout stopped at the fringes of the conflict END_TOKEN
the men from bridge four finally backed down one corridor , and sadeas’s soldiers retreated up the one opposite END_TOKEN
just far enough that they could still glare at one another END_TOKEN
you’d better be ready for damnation’s own thunder , sadeas’s officer shouted at dalinar END_TOKEN
teft of bridge four shouted back END_TOKEN
probably tripped on his own knife END_TOKEN
serves him well , the storming bastard END_TOKEN
the bridgeman looked abashed , then saluted with a stiff gesture END_TOKEN
dalinar knelt , pulling the jacket back from sadeas’s face END_TOKEN
he’s been lying here for some time END_TOKEN
we’ve been looking for him , said the officer in green END_TOKEN
thought he might have returned to another part of the tower , a man said END_TOKEN
we spent last night searching for him there END_TOKEN
some people said they thought they’d seen him , but they were wrong , and…
and a highprince was left lying here in his own gore for half a day , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
we couldn’t find him , the officer said , because your men murdered him and moved the body—
that blood has been pooling there for hours END_TOKEN
place the highprince in that side room there and send for ialai , if you haven’t END_TOKEN
i want to have a better look END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin was a connoisseur of death END_TOKEN
even since his youth , the sight of dead men had been a familiar thing to him END_TOKEN
you stay on the battlefield long enough , and you become familiar with its master END_TOKEN
so sadeas’s bloodied , ruined face didn’t shock him END_TOKEN
the punctured eye , smashed up into the socket by a blade that had been rammed into the brain END_TOKEN
fluid and blood had leaked out , then dried END_TOKEN
a knife through the eye was the sort of wound that killed an armored man wearing a full helm END_TOKEN
it was a maneuver you practiced to use on the battlefield END_TOKEN
but sadeas had not been wearing armor and had not been on a battlefield END_TOKEN
dalinar leaned down , inspecting the body lit by flickering oil lanterns as it lay on the table END_TOKEN
assassin , navani said , clicking her tongue and shaking her head END_TOKEN
behind him , adolin and renarin gathered with shallan and a few of the bridgemen END_TOKEN
across from dalinar stood kalami ; the thin , orange - eyed woman was one of his more senior scribes END_TOKEN
they’d lost her husband , teleb , in the battle against the voidbringers END_TOKEN
he hated to call upon her in her time of grief , but she insisted that she remain on duty END_TOKEN
storms , he had so few high officers left END_TOKEN
cael had fallen in the clash between everstorm and highstorm , almost making it to safety END_TOKEN
he’d lost ilamar and perethom to sadeas’s betrayal at the tower END_TOKEN
the only highlord he had left was khal , who was still recuperating from a wound he’d taken during the clash with the voidbringers—one he’d kept to himself until everyone else was safe END_TOKEN
even elhokar , the king , had been wounded by assassins in his palace while the armies were fighting at narak END_TOKEN
dalinar wasn’t certain if he would come to see sadeas’s body or not END_TOKEN
either way , dalinar’s lack of offi ers explained the room’s other occupants : highprince sebarial and his mistress , palona END_TOKEN
likable or not , sebarial was one of the two living highprinces who had responded to dalinar’s call to march for narak END_TOKEN
dalinar had to rely on someone , and he didn’t trust most of the highprinces farther than the wind could blow them END_TOKEN
sebarial , along with aladar—who had been summoned but had not yet arrived—would have to form the foundation of a new alethkar END_TOKEN
said palona , hands on hips as she regarded sadeas’s corpse END_TOKEN
i guess that’s one problem solved END_TOKEN
everyone in the room turned toward her END_TOKEN
don’t tell me you weren’t all thinking it END_TOKEN
this is going to look bad , brightlord , kalami said END_TOKEN
everyone is going to act like those soldiers outside and assume you had him assassinated END_TOKEN
no , sir , one of the bridgemen said END_TOKEN
whoever killed him probably took it END_TOKEN
navani rubbed dalinar on the shoulder END_TOKEN
i wouldn’t have put it as palona did , but he did try to have you killed END_TOKEN
perhaps this is for the best END_TOKEN
no , dalinar said , voice hoarse END_TOKEN
i know you’re desperate , dalinar , sebarial said END_TOKEN
my presence here is sufficient proof of that END_TOKEN
but surely we haven’t sunk so far as to be better off with sadeas among us END_TOKEN
dalinar looked up , inspecting those in the room END_TOKEN
teft and sigzil , the lieutenants from bridge four END_TOKEN
a handful of other soldiers , including the young scout woman who had fetched him END_TOKEN
his sons , steady adolin and impenetrable renarin END_TOKEN
navani , with her hand on his shoulder END_TOKEN
even the aging kalami , hands clasped before her , meeting his eyes and nodding END_TOKEN
you all agree , don’t you END_TOKEN
yes , this murder was inconvenient for dalinar’s reputation , and they certainly wouldn’t have gone so far as to kill sadeas themselves END_TOKEN
but now that he was gone… well , why shed any tears END_TOKEN
days spent with sadeas , listening to gavilar’s grand plans END_TOKEN
the night before dalinar’s wedding , when he’d shared wine with sadeas at a rowdy feast that sadeas had organized in his name END_TOKEN
it was hard to reconcile that younger man , that friend , with the thicker , older face on the slab before him END_TOKEN
the adult sadeas had been a murderer whose treachery had caused the deaths of better men END_TOKEN
for those men , abandoned during the battle at the tower , dalinar could feel only satisfaction at finally seeing sadeas dead END_TOKEN
he knew exactly how the others were feeling END_TOKEN
he left the body and strode out of the room END_TOKEN
he passed sadeas’s guards , who hurried back in END_TOKEN
they would deal with the corpse ; hopefully he’d defused the situation enough to prevent an impromptu clash between his forces and theirs END_TOKEN
for now , the best thing to do was get bridge four away from here END_TOKEN
dalinar’s retinue followed him through the halls of the cavernous tower , bearing oil lamps END_TOKEN
the walls were twisted with lines—natural strata of alternating earthy colors , like those made by crem drying in layers END_TOKEN
he didn’t blame the soldiers for losing track of sadeas ; it was strikingly easy to get lost in this place , with its endless passageways all leading into darkness END_TOKEN
fortunately , he had an idea of where they were , and led his people to the outer rim of the tower END_TOKEN
here he strode through an empty chamber and stepped out onto a balcony , one of many similar ones that were like wide patios END_TOKEN
above him rose the enormous tower city of urithiru , a strikingly high structure built up against the mountains END_TOKEN
created from a sequence of ten ringlike tiers—each containing eighteen levels—the tower city was adorned with aqueducts , windows , and balconies like this one END_TOKEN
the bottom floor also had wide sections jutting out at the perimeter : large stone surfaces , each a plateau in its own right END_TOKEN
they had stone railings at their edges , where the rock fell away into the depths of the chasms between mountain peaks END_TOKEN
at first , these wide flat sections of stone had baffled them END_TOKEN
but the furrows in the stone , and planter boxes on the inner edges , had revealed their purpose END_TOKEN
like the large spaces for gardens atop each tier of the tower , this area had been farmed , despite the cold END_TOKEN
one of these fields extended below this balcony , two levels down END_TOKEN
dalinar strode up to the edge of the balcony and rested his hands on the smooth stone retaining wall END_TOKEN
along the way they’d picked up highprince aladar , a distinguished bald alethi with dark tan skin END_TOKEN
he was accompanied by may , his daughter : a short , pretty woman in her twenties with tan eyes and a round face , her jet - black alethi hair worn short and curving around her face END_TOKEN
navani whispered to them the details of sadeas’s death END_TOKEN
dalinar swept his hand outward in the chill air , pointing away from the balcony END_TOKEN
the bridgemen gathered to look off the balcony END_TOKEN
their number included the herdazian , who now had two arms after regrowing the one with stormlight END_TOKEN
kaladin’s men had begun manifesting powers as windrunners— though apparently they were merely squires END_TOKEN
navani said it was a type of apprentice radiant that had once been common : men and women whose abilities were tied to their master , a full radiant END_TOKEN
the men of bridge four had not bonded their own spren , and—though they had started manifesting powers—had lost their abilities when kaladin had flown to alethkar to warn his family of the everstorm END_TOKEN
lots of clouds , another bridgeman added END_TOKEN
some mountains too , another said END_TOKEN
nah , horns , the herdazian argued END_TOKEN
we , dalinar interrupted , are above the storms END_TOKEN
it’s going to be easy to forget the tempest the rest of the world is facing END_TOKEN
the everstorm will return , bringing the voidbringers END_TOKEN
we have to assume that this city—our armies— will soon be the only bastion of order left in the world END_TOKEN
it is our calling , our duty , to take the lead END_TOKEN
dalinar , have you seen our armies END_TOKEN
they fought an impossible battle only six days ago , and despite being rescued , we technically lost END_TOKEN
roion’s son is woefully underprepared for dealing with the remnants of his princedom END_TOKEN
some of the strongest forces—those of thanadal and vamah—stayed behind in the warcamps END_TOKEN
the ones who did come are already squabbling , palona added END_TOKEN
old torol’s death back there will only give them something else to dissent about END_TOKEN
dalinar turned around , gripping the top of the stone wall with both hands , fingers cold END_TOKEN
a chill wind blew against him , and a few windspren passed like little translucent people riding on the breeze END_TOKEN
what do you know of the desolations END_TOKEN
you’ve done scholarly work on vorin theory , yes END_TOKEN
can you tell us of the desolations END_TOKEN
they were destruction made manifest , brightlord END_TOKEN
each one was so profoundly devastating that humankind was left broken END_TOKEN
populations ruined , society crippled , scholars dead END_TOKEN
humankind was forced to spend generations rebuilding after each one END_TOKEN
songs tell of how the losses compounded upon one another , causing us to slide farther each time , until the heralds left a people with swords and fabrials and returned to find them wielding sticks and stone axes END_TOKEN
they came to annihilate , kalami said END_TOKEN
their goal was to wipe humankind from roshar END_TOKEN
they were specters , formless—some say they are spirits of the dead , others spren from damnation END_TOKEN
we will have to find a way to stop this from happening again , dalinar said softly , turning back to the group END_TOKEN
we are the ones this world must be able to look to END_TOKEN
we must provide stability , a rallying point END_TOKEN
this is why i cannot rejoice to find sadeas dead END_TOKEN
he was a thorn in my side , but he was a capable general and a brilliant mind END_TOKEN
before this is through , we’ll need everyone who can fight END_TOKEN
i used to be like the other highprinces END_TOKEN
but what i saw on that battlefield… those red eyes… sir , i’m with you END_TOKEN
i will follow you to the ends of the storms themselves END_TOKEN
what do you want me to do END_TOKEN
aladar , i name you our new highprince of information , in command of the judgment and law of this city END_TOKEN
establish order in urithiru and make sure that the highprinces have clearly delineated realms of control within it END_TOKEN
build a policing force , and patrol these hallways END_TOKEN
keep the peace , and prevent clashes between soldiers like the one we avoided earlier END_TOKEN
sebarial , i name you highprince of commerce END_TOKEN
account our supplies and establish marketplaces in urithiru END_TOKEN
i want this tower to become a functioning city , not just a temporary waystop END_TOKEN
adolin , see that the armies are put into a training regimen END_TOKEN
count the troops we have , from all the highprinces , and convey to them that their spears will be required for the defense of roshar END_TOKEN
so long as they remain here , they are under my authority as highprince of war END_TOKEN
we’ll crush their squabbling beneath a weight of training END_TOKEN
we control the soulcasters , and we control the food END_TOKEN
if they want rations , they’ll have to listen END_TOKEN
the scruffy lieutenant of bridge four asked END_TOKEN
continue to explore urithiru with my scouts and scribes , dalinar said END_TOKEN
and let me know the moment your captain returns END_TOKEN
hopefully he will bring good news from alethkar END_TOKEN
a voice echoed in the back of his mind , as if distant END_TOKEN
be ready for when the enemy’s champion arrives END_TOKEN
our ultimate goal is the preservation of all roshar , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
we’ve seen the cost of division in our ranks END_TOKEN
because of it , we failed to stop the everstorm END_TOKEN
but that was just the trial run , the sparring before the real fight END_TOKEN
to face the desolation , i will find a way to do what my ancestor the sunmaker failed to do through conquest END_TOKEN
no man had ever united the entire continent— not during the shin invasions , not during the height of the hierocracy , not during the sunmaker’s conquest END_TOKEN
this was his task , he was increasingly certain END_TOKEN
the enemy would unleash his worst terrors : the unmade and the voidbringers END_TOKEN
that phantom champion in the dark armor END_TOKEN
dalinar would resist them with a unified roshar END_TOKEN
such a shame he hadn’t found a way to somehow convince sadeas to join in his cause END_TOKEN
ah , torol , he thought END_TOKEN
what we could have done together , if we hadn’t been so divided END_TOKEN
a soft voice drew his attention END_TOKEN
renarin , who stood beside shallan and adolin END_TOKEN
other radiants will be coming to us , and you two will need to lead them END_TOKEN
the knights were once our greatest weapon against the voidbringers END_TOKEN
they will need to be so again END_TOKEN
father , i… renarin stumbled over the words END_TOKEN
i don’t know how to… let alone…
son , dalinar said , stepping over END_TOKEN
he took renarin by the shoulder END_TOKEN
the almighty and the spren have granted you powers to defend and protect this people END_TOKEN
master them , then report back to me what you can do END_TOKEN
i think we’re all curious to find out END_TOKEN
renarin exhaled softly , then nodded END_TOKEN
rockbuds crunched like skulls beneath dalinar’s boots as he charged across the burning field END_TOKEN
his elites pounded after him , a handpicked force of soldiers both lighteyed and dark END_TOKEN
these were simply the men he considered competent enough not to embarrass him END_TOKEN
moss—dried from the summer heat and long days between storms this time of year—flared up in waves , setting the rockbud shells alight END_TOKEN
and , like a spren himself , dalinar charged through the smoke , trusting in his padded armor and thick boots to protect him END_TOKEN
the enemy—pressed on the north by his armies—had pulled back into this town just ahead END_TOKEN
with some difficulty dalinar had waited , so he could bring his elites in as a flanking force END_TOKEN
he hadn’t expected the enemy to fire this plain , desperately burning their own crops to block the southern approach END_TOKEN
well , the fires could go to damnation END_TOKEN
though some of his men were overwhelmed by the smoke or heat , most stayed with him END_TOKEN
they’d crash into the enemy , pressing them back against the main army END_TOKEN
his favorite kind of tactic : the type that didn’t allow his enemies to get away from him END_TOKEN
as dalinar burst from the smoky air , he found a few lines of spearmen hastily forming ranks on the southern edge of the town END_TOKEN
anticipationspren— like red streamers growing from the ground and whipping in the wind— clustered around them END_TOKEN
the low town wall had been torn down in a contest a few years back , so the soldiers had only rubble as a fortification—though a large ridge to the east made a natural windbreak against the storms , which had allowed this place to sprawl almost like a real city END_TOKEN
dalinar bellowed at the enemy soldiers , beating his sword—just an ordinary longsword—against his shield END_TOKEN
he wore a sturdy breastplate , an openfronted helm , and iron - reinforced boots END_TOKEN
the spearmen ahead of him wavered as his elites roared from amid the smoke and flame , shouting a bloodthirsty cacophony END_TOKEN
a few of the spearmen dropped their weapons and ran END_TOKEN
he didn’t need shards to intimidate END_TOKEN
he hit the spearmen like a boulder rolling through a grove of saplings , his sword tossing blood into the air END_TOKEN
a good fight was about momentum END_TOKEN
drive forward and convince your enemies that they’re as good as dead already END_TOKEN
that way , they’ll fight you less as you send them to their pyres END_TOKEN
the spearmen thrust their spears frantically—less to try to kill , more to try to push away this madman END_TOKEN
their ranks collapsed as too many of them turned their attention toward him END_TOKEN
dalinar laughed , slamming aside a pair of spears with his shield , then disemboweling one man with a blade deep in the gut END_TOKEN
the man dropped his spear in agony , and his neighbors backed away at the horrific sight END_TOKEN
dalinar came in with a roar , killing them with a sword that bore their friend’s blood END_TOKEN
dalinar’s elites struck the now - broken line , and the real slaughter began END_TOKEN
he pushed forward , keeping momentum , shearing through the ranks until he reached the back , then breathed deeply and wiped ashen sweat from his face END_TOKEN
a young spearman wept on the ground nearby , screaming for his mother as he crawled across the stone , trailing blood END_TOKEN
fearspren mixed with orange , sinewy painspren all around END_TOKEN
dalinar shook his head and rammed his sword down into the boy’s back as he passed END_TOKEN
men often cried for their parents as they died END_TOKEN
didn’t matter how old they were END_TOKEN
he’d seen greybeards do it , same as kids like this one END_TOKEN
he’s not much younger than me , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
but then , dalinar had never felt young , regardless of his age END_TOKEN
his elites carved the enemy line in two END_TOKEN
dalinar danced , shaking off his bloodied blade , feeling alert , excited , but not yet alive END_TOKEN
a larger group of enemy soldiers was jogging down the street toward him , led by several officers in white and red END_TOKEN
from the way they suddenly pulled up , he guessed they were alarmed to find their spearmen falling so quickly END_TOKEN
his elites knew to watch , so he was quickly joined by fifty men—the rest had to finish off the unfortunate spearmen END_TOKEN
the crowded confines of the town would mean dalinar shouldn’t need more END_TOKEN
he focused his attention on the one man riding a horse END_TOKEN
the fellow wore plate armor obviously meant to resemble shardplate , though it was only of common steel END_TOKEN
it lacked the beauty , the power , of true plate END_TOKEN
he still looked like he was the most important person around END_TOKEN
hopefully that would mean he was the best END_TOKEN
the man’s honor guard rushed to engage , and dalinar felt something stir inside him END_TOKEN
like a thirst , a physical need END_TOKEN
he engaged the first member of the guard , attacking with a swift brutality END_TOKEN
fighting on a battlefield wasn’t like dueling in an arena ; dalinar didn’t dance around the fellow , testing his abilities END_TOKEN
out here , that sort of thing got you stabbed in the back by someone else END_TOKEN
instead , dalinar slammed his sword down against the enemy , who raised his shield to block END_TOKEN
dalinar struck a series of quick , powerful blows , like a drummer pounding out a furious beat END_TOKEN
bam , bam , bam , bam END_TOKEN
the enemy soldier clutched his shield over his head , leaving dalinar squarely in control END_TOKEN
dalinar raised his own shield before him and shoved it against the man , forcing him back until he stumbled , giving dalinar an opening END_TOKEN
this man didn’t get a chance to cry for his mother END_TOKEN
dalinar let his elites handle the others ; the way was open to the brightlord END_TOKEN
the highprince fought to the north END_TOKEN
was this some other important lighteyes END_TOKEN
or… didn’t dalinar remember hearing something about a son during gavilar’s endless planning meetings END_TOKEN
well , this man certainly looked grand on that white mare , watching the battle from within his helm’s visor , cape streaming around him END_TOKEN
the foe raised his sword to his helm toward dalinar in a sign of challenge accepted END_TOKEN
dalinar raised his shield arm and pointed , counting on at least one of his strikers to have stayed with him END_TOKEN
indeed , jenin stepped up , unhooked the shortbow from his back , and—as the brightlord shouted his surprise— shot the horse in the chest END_TOKEN
hate shooting horses , jenin grumbled as the beast reared in pain END_TOKEN
like throwing a thousand broams into the storming ocean , brightlord END_TOKEN
i’ll buy you two when we finish this , dalinar said as the brightlord tumbled off his horse END_TOKEN
dalinar dodged around flashing hooves and squeals of pain , seeking out the fallen man END_TOKEN
he was pleased to find the enemy rising END_TOKEN
they engaged , sweeping at one another , frantic END_TOKEN
pick a direction and don’t let anything—man or storm—turn you aside END_TOKEN
dalinar battered at the brightlord , driving him backward , furious and persistent END_TOKEN
he felt like he was winning the contest , controlling it , right up until he slammed his shield at the enemy and—in the moment of stress—felt something snap END_TOKEN
one of the straps that held the shield to his arm had broken END_TOKEN
he shoved the shield , twisting it around dalinar’s arm , snapping the other strap END_TOKEN
dalinar staggered , sweeping with his sword , trying to parry a blow that didn’t come END_TOKEN
the brightlord instead lunged in close and rammed dalinar with his shield END_TOKEN
dalinar ducked the blow that followed , but the backhand hit him solidly on the side of the head , sending him stumbling END_TOKEN
his helm twisted , bent metal biting into his scalp , drawing blood END_TOKEN
he saw double , his vision swimming END_TOKEN
he’s coming in for the kill END_TOKEN
dalinar roared , swinging his blade up in a lurching , wild parry that connected with the brightlord’s weapon and swept it completely out of his hands END_TOKEN
the man instead punched dalinar in the face with a gauntlet END_TOKEN
dalinar fell to his knees , sword slipping from his fingers END_TOKEN
his foe was breathing deeply , cursing between breaths , winded by the short , frantic contest END_TOKEN
he reached to his belt for a knife END_TOKEN
it was a fire that filled the pit within END_TOKEN
it washed through him and awakened him , bringing clarity END_TOKEN
the sounds of his elites fighting the brightlord’s honor guard faded , metal on metal becoming clinks , grunts becoming merely a distant humming END_TOKEN
then the smile became a toothy grin END_TOKEN
his vision returned as the brightlord—knife in hand—looked up and started , stumbling back END_TOKEN
dalinar roared , spitting blood and throwing himself at the enemy END_TOKEN
the swing that came at him seemed pitiful and dalinar ducked it , ramming his shoulder against his foe’s lower body END_TOKEN
something thrummed inside dalinar , the pulse of the battle , the rhythm of killing and dying END_TOKEN
he knocked his opponent off balance , then went searching for his sword END_TOKEN
dym , however , hollered dalinar’s name and tossed him a poleaxe , with a hook on one side and a broad , thin axe blade on the other END_TOKEN
dalinar seized it from the air and spun , hooking the brightlord around the ankle with the axehead , then yanked END_TOKEN
the brightlord fell in a clatter of steel END_TOKEN
before dalinar could capitalize on this , two men of the honor guard managed to extricate themselves from dalinar’s men and come to the defense of their brightlord END_TOKEN
dalinar swung and buried the axehead into one guard’s side END_TOKEN
he ripped it free and spun again—smashing the weapon down on the rising brightlord’s helm and sending him to his knees—before coming back and barely catching the remaining guard’s sword on the haft of the poleaxe END_TOKEN
dalinar pushed upward , holding the poleaxe in two hands , sweeping the guard’s blade into the air over his head END_TOKEN
dalinar stepped forward until he was face - to - face with the fellow END_TOKEN
he could feel the man’s breath END_TOKEN
he spat blood draining from his nose into the guard’s eyes , then kicked him in the stomach END_TOKEN
he turned toward the brightlord , who was trying to flee END_TOKEN
dalinar growled , full of the thrill END_TOKEN
he swung the poleaxe with one hand , hooking the spike into the brightlord’s side , and yanked , dropping him yet again END_TOKEN
he was greeted by the sight of dalinar slamming his poleaxe down with both hands , driving the spike right through the breastplate and into his chest END_TOKEN
it made a satisfying crunch , and dalinar pulled it out bloodied END_TOKEN
as if that blow had been a signal , the honor guard finally broke before his elites END_TOKEN
dalinar grinned as he watched them go , gloryspren popping up around him as glowing golden spheres END_TOKEN
his men unhooked shortbows and shot a good dozen of the fleeing enemy in the back END_TOKEN
damnation , it felt good to best a force larger than your own END_TOKEN
nearby , the fallen brightlord groaned softly END_TOKEN
why… the man said from within his helm END_TOKEN
don’t know , dalinar said , tossing the poleaxe back to dym END_TOKEN
my brother chooses , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i just go where he points me END_TOKEN
he gestured toward the dying man , and dym rammed a sword into the armored man’s armpit , finishing the job END_TOKEN
the fellow had fought reasonably well ; no need to extend his suffering END_TOKEN
another soldier approached , handing dalinar his sword END_TOKEN
it had a chip the size of a thumb right in the blade END_TOKEN
looked like it had bent as well END_TOKEN
you’re supposed to stick it into the squishy parts , brightlord , dym said , not pound it against the hard parts END_TOKEN
i’ll keep that in mind , dalinar said , tossing the sword aside as one of his men selected a replacement from among the fallen END_TOKEN
never been better , dalinar said , voice faintly distorted by the clogged nose END_TOKEN
hurt like damnation itself , and he drew a small flock of painspren— like little sinewy hands—up from the ground END_TOKEN
his men formed up around him , and dalinar led the way farther down the street END_TOKEN
before too long , he could make out the bulk of the enemy still fighting ahead , harried by his army END_TOKEN
he halted his men , considering his options END_TOKEN
thakka , captain of the elites , turned to him END_TOKEN
raid those buildings , dalinar said , pointing at a line of homes END_TOKEN
let’s see how well they fight while they watch us rounding up their families END_TOKEN
the men will want to loot , thakka said END_TOKEN
what is there to loot in hovels like these END_TOKEN
soggy hogshide and old rockbud bowls END_TOKEN
he pulled off his helm to wipe the blood from his face END_TOKEN
there are civilians somewhere in this storming town END_TOKEN
thakka nodded , shouting the orders END_TOKEN
he’d need to meet up with sadeas , and—
he caught only a brief sight of it , a black blur that hit with the force of a roundhouse kick END_TOKEN
it threw him down , and pain flared up from his side END_TOKEN
he blinked as he found himself lying on the ground END_TOKEN
a storming arrow sprouted from his right shoulder , with a long , thick shaft END_TOKEN
it had gone straight through the chain mail , just to the side of where his cuirass met his arm END_TOKEN
thakka said , kneeling , shielding dalinar with his body END_TOKEN
up there , one of his men said , pointing at the ridge above the town END_TOKEN
that’s got to be over three hundred yards , dalinar said , shoving thakka aside and standing END_TOKEN
he was watching , so he was able to jump out of the way of the next arrow , which dropped a mere foot from him , cracking against the stone ground END_TOKEN
dalinar stared at it , then started shouting END_TOKEN
a small group of soldiers came trotting forward , bringing all eleven horses , which they’d guided carefully across the field END_TOKEN
dalinar had to dodge another arrow as he seized the reins of fullnight , his black gelding , and heaved himself into the saddle END_TOKEN
the arrow in his arm was a cutting pain , but he felt something more pressing drawing him forward END_TOKEN
he galloped back the way they’d come in , getting out of the archer’s sight , trailed by ten of his best men END_TOKEN
there had to be a way up that slope END_TOKEN
a rocky set of switchbacks , shallow enough that he didn’t mind running fullnight up them END_TOKEN
dalinar worried that by the time he reached the top , his quarry would have escaped END_TOKEN
however , when he eventually burst onto the top of the ridge , an arrow slammed into his left breast , going straight through the breastplate near the shoulder , nearly throwing him from the saddle END_TOKEN
dalinar hung on somehow , clenching the reins in one hand , and leaned low , peering ahead as the archer—still a distant figure—stood upon a rocky knob and launched another arrow END_TOKEN
storms , the fellow was quick END_TOKEN
he jerked fullnight to one side , then the other , feeling the thrumming sense of the thrill surge within him END_TOKEN
it drove away the pain , let him focus END_TOKEN
ahead , the archer finally seemed to grow alarmed , and leaped from his perch to flee END_TOKEN
dalinar charged fullnight over that knob a moment later END_TOKEN
the archer turned out to be a man in his twenties wearing rugged clothing , with arms and shoulders that looked like they could have lifted a chull END_TOKEN
dalinar had the option of running him down , but instead galloped fullnight past and kicked the man in the back , sending him sprawling END_TOKEN
he pulled up his horse , the motion sending a spike of pain through his arm END_TOKEN
he forced it down , eyes watering , and turned toward the archer , who lay in a heap amid spilled black arrows END_TOKEN
dalinar lurched from the saddle , an arrow sprouting from each shoulder , as his men caught up END_TOKEN
he seized the archer and hauled the fellow to his feet , noting the blue tattoo on his cheek END_TOKEN
the archer gasped and stared at dalinar END_TOKEN
he expected he was quite a sight , covered in soot from the fires , his face a mask of blood from the nose and the cut scalp , stuck with not one but two arrows END_TOKEN
you waited until my helm was off , dalinar demanded END_TOKEN
you were set here specifically to kill me END_TOKEN
the man winced , then nodded END_TOKEN
dalinar said , letting go of the fellow END_TOKEN
how far is that , thakka END_TOKEN
almost four , thakka said , pulling over his horse END_TOKEN
still , dalinar said , stepping up to the lip of the ridge END_TOKEN
he looked back at the befuddled archer END_TOKEN
the archer regarded the ten elites on horseback , grim - faced and dangerous , before wisely deciding to obey END_TOKEN
he picked up an arrow , then his bow—which was made of a sleek black wood dalinar didn’t recognize END_TOKEN
went right through my storming armor , dalinar muttered , feeling at the arrow that had hit him on the left END_TOKEN
that one didn’t seem too bad—it had punctured the steel , but had lost most of its momentum in doing so END_TOKEN
the one on his right , though , had cut through the chain and was sending blood down his arm END_TOKEN
he shook his head , shading his eyes with his left hand , inspecting the battlefield END_TOKEN
to his right , the armies clashed , and his main body of elites had come up to press at the flank END_TOKEN
the rearguard had found some civilians and was shoving them into the street END_TOKEN
pick a corpse , dalinar said , pointing toward an empty square where a skirmish had happened END_TOKEN
stick an arrow in one down there , if you can END_TOKEN
the archer licked his lips , still seeming confused END_TOKEN
finally , he took a spyglass off his belt and studied the area END_TOKEN
the one in blue , near the overturned cart END_TOKEN
nearby , thakka had climbed off his horse and had slid out his sword , resting it on his shoulder END_TOKEN
a not - so - subtle warning END_TOKEN
the archer drew his bow and launched a single black - fletched arrow END_TOKEN
it flew true , sticking into the chosen corpse END_TOKEN
a single awespren burst around dalinar , like a ring of blue smoke END_TOKEN
thakka , before today , i’d have bet you half the princedom that such a shot wasn’t possible END_TOKEN
the man raised his chin , but didn’t reply END_TOKEN
well , in any case , welcome to my elites , dalinar said END_TOKEN
someone get the fellow a horse END_TOKEN
i can make use of someone with your skills END_TOKEN
dalinar nodded toward the town below , where the beleaguered enemy army was—at long last—surrendering END_TOKEN
looks like we’re all allies now END_TOKEN
the archer spat to the side END_TOKEN
slaves beneath your brother , the tyrant END_TOKEN
dalinar let one of his men help him onto his horse END_TOKEN
if you’d rather be killed , i can respect that END_TOKEN
alternatively , you can join me and name your price END_TOKEN
the life of my brightlord yezriar , the archer said END_TOKEN
dalinar said , looking to thakka END_TOKEN
he’s got a hole in his chest , dalinar said , looking back to the assassin END_TOKEN
the other princedoms are digging in their heels END_TOKEN
refuse to recognize my brother’s crown END_TOKEN
games of catch - me with the high lighteyes just encourage people to fight back END_TOKEN
if they know we’re out for blood , they’ll think twice END_TOKEN
join with me , and we won’t pillage the town END_TOKEN
what’s left of it , anyway END_TOKEN
the man looked down at the surrendering army END_TOKEN
i promise not to make you shoot anyone you like END_TOKEN
dalinar said , turning his horse and trotting off END_TOKEN
a short time later , when dalinar’s elites rode up to him , the sullen archer was on a horse with one of the other men END_TOKEN
the pain surged in dalinar’s right arm as the thrill faded , but it was manageable END_TOKEN
he’d need surgeons to look at the arrow wound END_TOKEN
once they reached the town again , he sent orders to stop the looting END_TOKEN
his men would hate that , but this town wasn’t worth much anyway END_TOKEN
the riches would come once they started into the centers of the princedoms END_TOKEN
he let his horse carry him in a leisurely gait through the town , passing soldiers who had settled down to water themselves and rest from the protracted engagement END_TOKEN
his nose still smarted , and he had to forcibly prevent himself from snorting up blood END_TOKEN
if it was well and truly broken , that wouldn’t turn out well for him END_TOKEN
dalinar kept moving , fighting off the dull sense of… nothingness that often followed a battle END_TOKEN
he could still remember being alive , but now had to face a return to mundanity END_TOKEN
sadeas already had the local highprince’s head—and those of his officers—up on spears END_TOKEN
such a showman , sadeas was END_TOKEN
dalinar passed the grim line , shaking his head , and heard a muttered curse from his new archer END_TOKEN
he’d have to talk to the man , reinforce that in striking at dalinar earlier , he’d shot an arrow at an enemy END_TOKEN
if he tried something against dalinar or sadeas now , it would be different END_TOKEN
thakka would already be searching out the fellow’s family END_TOKEN
he stilled his horse , turning toward the sound END_TOKEN
torol sadeas—resplendent in golden yellow shardplate that had already been washed clean—pushed through a cluster of officers END_TOKEN
the red - faced young man looked far older than he had a year ago END_TOKEN
when they’d started all this , he’d still been gangly youth END_TOKEN
stormfather , man , you look like a thornbush END_TOKEN
a fist , dalinar said , then nodded toward the heads on spears END_TOKEN
we lost the crown prince , sadeas said END_TOKEN
that would be impressive , dalinar said , considering what i did to him END_TOKEN
what would we do without you END_TOKEN
someone get me something to drink and a pair of surgeons END_TOKEN
also , sadeas , i promised we wouldn’t pillage the city END_TOKEN
no looting , no slaves taken END_TOKEN
dalinar thumbed over his shoulder at the archer END_TOKEN
he’s got amazing aim , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he glanced to the side , where sadeas’s soldiers had rounded up some weeping women for sadeas to pick from END_TOKEN
i was looking forward to tonight , sadeas noted END_TOKEN
and i was looking forward to breathing through my nose END_TOKEN
more than can be said for the kids we fought today END_TOKEN
fine , fine , sadeas said , sighing END_TOKEN
i suppose we could spare one town END_TOKEN
a symbol that we are not without mercy END_TOKEN
we need to get you some shards , my friend END_TOKEN
storms , dalinar , at this point i’m not certain a rockslide could kill you END_TOKEN
no , it just makes the rest of us look bad when you accomplish what you do while practically unarmed END_TOKEN
he didn’t wait for the wine or the surgeons , but instead led his horse back to gather his elites and reinforce the orders to guard the city from looting END_TOKEN
once finished , he walked his horse across smoldering ground to his camp END_TOKEN
he was done living for the day END_TOKEN
it would be weeks , maybe months , before he got another opportunity END_TOKEN
i know that many women who read this will see it only as further proof that i am the godless heretic everyone claims END_TOKEN
two days after sadeas was found dead , the everstorm came again END_TOKEN
dalinar walked through his chambers in urithiru , pulled by the unnatural storm END_TOKEN
he passed navani—who sat at the writing desk working on her memoirs again—and stepped onto his balcony , which hung straight out over the cliffs beneath urithiru END_TOKEN
he could feel something , his ears popping , cold—even more cold than usual—blowing in from the west END_TOKEN
this thing is not natural , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
it didn’t come before , during the earlier desolations END_TOKEN
as always , the stormfather’s voice was far off , like very distant thunder END_TOKEN
the stormfather didn’t always reply to dalinar , and didn’t remain near him END_TOKEN
that was to be expected ; he was the soul of the storm END_TOKEN
and yet , there was an almost childish petulance to the way he sometimes ignored dalinar’s questions END_TOKEN
it seemed that sometimes he did so merely because he didn’t want dalinar to think that he would come whenever called END_TOKEN
the everstorm appeared in the distance , its black clouds lit from within by crackling red lightning END_TOKEN
it was low enough in the sky that—fortunately—its top wouldn’t reach urithiru END_TOKEN
it surged like a cavalry , trampling the calm , ordinary clouds below END_TOKEN
dalinar forced himself to watch that wave of darkness flow around urithiru’s plateau END_TOKEN
soon it seemed as if their lonely tower were a lighthouse looking over a dark , deadly sea END_TOKEN
those red lightning bolts didn’t rumble with thunder in the proper way END_TOKEN
he heard the occasional crack , stark and shocking , like a hundred branches snapping at once END_TOKEN
but the sounds didn’t seem to match the flashes of red light that rose from deep within END_TOKEN
the storm was so quiet , in fact , that he was able to hear the telltale rustle of cloth as navani slipped up behind him END_TOKEN
she wrapped her arms around him , pressing against his back , resting her head against his shoulder END_TOKEN
his eyes flickered down , and he noticed that she’d removed the glove from her safehand END_TOKEN
it was barely visible in the dark : slender , gorgeous fingers—delicate , with the nails painted a blushing red END_TOKEN
he saw it by the light of the first moon above , and by the intermittent flashes of the storm beneath END_TOKEN
any further word from the west END_TOKEN
the everstorm was slower than a highstorm , and had hit shinovar many hours before END_TOKEN
it did not recharge spheres , even if you left them out during the entire everstorm END_TOKEN
the monarchs are delaying a response , but i suspect that soon they’ll realize they have to listen to us END_TOKEN
i think you underestimate the stubbornness a crown can press into a man or woman’s mind , navani END_TOKEN
dalinar had been out during his share of highstorms , particularly in his youth END_TOKEN
he’d watched the chaos of the stormwall pushing rocks and refuse before it , the sky - splitting lightning , the claps of thunder END_TOKEN
highstorms were the ultimate expression of nature’s power : wild , untamed , sent to remind man of his insignificance END_TOKEN
however , highstorms never seemed hateful END_TOKEN
staring into that blackness below , dalinar thought he could see what it had done END_TOKEN
a series of impressions , thrown at him in anger END_TOKEN
the storm’s experiences as it had slowly crossed roshar END_TOKEN
houses ripped apart , screams of the occupants lost to the tempest END_TOKEN
people caught in their fields , running in a panic before the unpredicted storm END_TOKEN
and vast seas of glowing red eyes , coming awake like spheres suddenly renewed with stormlight END_TOKEN
dalinar hissed out a long , slow breath , the impressions fading END_TOKEN
he’s aware of you , dalinar END_TOKEN
not a vision of the past END_TOKEN
not some possibility of the future END_TOKEN
his kingdom , his people , his entire world was being attacked END_TOKEN
at the very least , this wasn’t the singular tempest that they’d experienced when the everstorm had clashed with the highstorm for the first time END_TOKEN
it wouldn’t tear down cities , but it did rain destruction upon them—and the winds would attack in bursts , hostile , even deliberate END_TOKEN
the enemy seemed more interested in preying upon the small towns END_TOKEN
though it was not as destructive as he’d feared , it would still leave thousands dead END_TOKEN
it would leave cities broken , particularly those without shelter to the west END_TOKEN
more importantly , it would steal the parshmen laborers and turn them into voidbringers , loosed on the public END_TOKEN
all in all , this storm would exact a price in blood from roshar that hadn’t been seen since… well , since the desolations END_TOKEN
he lifted his hand to grasp navani’s , as she in turn held to him END_TOKEN
you did what you could , dalinar , she whispered after a time watching END_TOKEN
don’t insist on carrying this failure as a burden END_TOKEN
she released him and turned him around , away from the sight of the storm END_TOKEN
she wore a dressing gown , not fit to go about in public , but also not precisely immodest END_TOKEN
save for that hand , with which she caressed his chin END_TOKEN
i , she whispered , don’t believe you , dalinar kholin END_TOKEN
i can read the truth in the tightness of your muscles , the set of your jaw END_TOKEN
i know that you , while being crushed beneath a boulder , would insist that you’ve got it under control and ask to see field reports from your men END_TOKEN
the scent of her was intoxicating END_TOKEN
and those entrancing , brilliant violet eyes END_TOKEN
you need to relax , dalinar , she said END_TOKEN
she looked at him , questioning , so beautiful END_TOKEN
far more gorgeous than when they’d been young END_TOKEN
for how could anyone be as beautiful as she was now END_TOKEN
he seized her by the back of the head and pulled her mouth to his own END_TOKEN
she pressed her body to his , breasts pushing against him through the thin gown END_TOKEN
he drank of her lips , her mouth , her scent END_TOKEN
passionspren fluttered around them like crystal flakes of snow END_TOKEN
dalinar stopped himself and stepped back END_TOKEN
dalinar , she said as he pulled away END_TOKEN
your stubborn refusal to get seduced is making me question my feminine wiles END_TOKEN
control is important to me , navani , he said , his voice hoarse END_TOKEN
he gripped the stone balcony wall , white knuckled END_TOKEN
you know how i was , what i became , when i was a man with no control END_TOKEN
she sighed and sidled up to him , pulling his arm free of the stone , then slipping under it END_TOKEN
i won’t push you , but i need to know END_TOKEN
is this how it’s going to continue END_TOKEN
teasing , dancing on the edge END_TOKEN
no , he said , staring out over the darkness of the storm END_TOKEN
that would be an exercise in futility END_TOKEN
a general knows not to set himself up for battles he cannot win END_TOKEN
i’ll find a way to do it right END_TOKEN
the promise , the act of being bound together END_TOKEN
she said , then poked him in the chest END_TOKEN
i’m as religious as the next woman—more than most , actually END_TOKEN
but kadash turned us down , as did ladent , even rushu END_TOKEN
she squeaked when i mentioned it and literally ran away END_TOKEN
chanada , dalinar said , speaking of the senior ardent of the warcamps END_TOKEN
she spoke to kadash , and had him go to each of the ardents END_TOKEN
she probably did it the moment she heard we were courting END_TOKEN
so no ardent will marry us , navani said END_TOKEN
you’re stretching to find an impossible accommodation ; continue with this , and it’s going to leave a lady wondering if you actually care END_TOKEN
you are the woman i love , dalinar said , pulling her tight END_TOKEN
a woman i have always loved END_TOKEN
let the ardents hie to damnation , with ribbons around their ankles END_TOKEN
i’m not the one telling everyone that god is dead END_TOKEN
he sighed , letting go of her—with reluctance—and walked back into his rooms , where a brazier of coal radiated welcome warmth , as well as the room’s only light END_TOKEN
they had recovered his fabrial heating device from the warcamps , but didn’t yet have the stormlight to run it END_TOKEN
the scholars had discovered long chains and cages , apparently used for lowering spheres down into the storms , so they’d be able to renew their spheres—if the highstorms ever returned END_TOKEN
in other parts of the world , the weeping had restarted , then fitfully stopped END_TOKEN
or the proper storms might start up END_TOKEN
nobody knew , and the stormfather refused to enlighten him END_TOKEN
navani entered and pulled the thick drapings closed over the doorway , tying them tightly in place END_TOKEN
this room was heaped with furniture , chairs lining the walls , rolled rugs stacked atop them END_TOKEN
there was even a standing mirror END_TOKEN
the images of twisting windspren along its sides bore the distinctly rounded look of something that had been carved first from weevilwax , then soulcast into hardwood END_TOKEN
they had deposited all this here for him , as if worried about their highprince living in simple stone quarters END_TOKEN
let’s have someone clear this out for me tomorrow , dalinar said END_TOKEN
there’s room enough for it in the chamber next door , which we can turn into a sitting room or a common room END_TOKEN
navani nodded as she settled onto one of the sofas—he saw her reflected in the mirror—her hand still casually uncovered , gown dropping to the side , exposing neck , collarbone , and some of what was beneath END_TOKEN
she wasn’t trying to be seductive right now ; she was merely comfortable around him END_TOKEN
intimately familiar , past the point where she felt embarrassed for him to see her uncovered END_TOKEN
it was good that one of them was willing to take the initiative in the relationship END_TOKEN
for all his impatience to advance on the battlefield , this was one area in which he’d always needed encouragement END_TOKEN
same as it had been all those years ago…
when i married last , dalinar said softly , i did many things wrong END_TOKEN
you married shshshsh for her shardplate , but many marriages are for political reasons END_TOKEN
that doesn’t mean you were wrong END_TOKEN
if you’ll recall , we all encouraged you to do it END_TOKEN
as always , when he heard his dead wife’s name , the word was replaced to his hearing with a breezy sound of rushing air—the name couldn’t gain purchase in his mind , any more than a man could hold to a gust of wind END_TOKEN
i’m not trying to replace her , dalinar , navani said , suddenly sounding concerned END_TOKEN
i know you still have affection for shshshsh END_TOKEN
i can share you with her memory END_TOKEN
oh , how little they all understood END_TOKEN
he turned toward navani , set his jaw against the pain , and said it END_TOKEN
i don’t remember her , navani END_TOKEN
she looked to him with a frown , as if she thought she hadn’t heard him correctly END_TOKEN
i can’t remember my wife at all , he said END_TOKEN
portraits of her are a fuzzy smudge to my eyes END_TOKEN
her name is taken from me whenever spoken , like someone has plucked it away END_TOKEN
i don’t remember what she and i said when we first met ; i can’t even remember seeing her at the feast that night when she first arrived END_TOKEN
i can remember some events surrounding my wife , but nothing of the actual details END_TOKEN
navani raised her safehand fingers to her mouth , and from the way her brow knit with concern , he figured he must look like he was in agony END_TOKEN
he slumped down in a chair across from her END_TOKEN
you said you knew both your boon and your curse END_TOKEN
people glance at me when her name comes up , dalinar continued , and they give me these looks of pity END_TOKEN
they see me keeping a stiff expression , and they assume i’m being stoic END_TOKEN
they infer hidden pain , when really i’m just trying to keep up END_TOKEN
it’s hard to follow a conversation where half of it keeps slipping away from your brain END_TOKEN
navani , maybe i did grow to love her END_TOKEN
not one moment of intimacy , not one fight , not a single word she ever said to me END_TOKEN
she’s gone , leaving debris that mars my memory END_TOKEN
i can’t remember how she died END_TOKEN
that one gets to me , because there are parts of that day i know i should remember END_TOKEN
something about a city in rebellion against my brother , and my wife being taken hostage END_TOKEN
that… and a long march alone , accompanied only by hatred and the thrill END_TOKEN
he’d brought vengeance to those who had taken his wife from him END_TOKEN
navani settled down on the seat beside dalinar , resting her head on his shoulder END_TOKEN
would that i could create a fabrial , she whispered , to take away this kind of pain END_TOKEN
i think… i think losing her must have hurt me terribly , dalinar whispered , because of what it drove me to do END_TOKEN
i am left with only the scars END_TOKEN
regardless , navani , i want it to be right with us END_TOKEN
done properly , with oaths , spoken to you before someone END_TOKEN
words are the most important things in my life right now END_TOKEN
she parted her lips , thoughtful END_TOKEN
i wouldn’t want to put him in that position END_TOKEN
that would be tantamount to declaring myself a heretic END_TOKEN
i will not defy the vorin church END_TOKEN
i might be willing to side - step it though END_TOKEN
he looked upward , toward the ceiling END_TOKEN
maybe we go to someone with authority greater than theirs END_TOKEN
you want a spren to marry us END_TOKEN
using a foreign priest would be heretical , but not a spren END_TOKEN
the stormfather is the largest remnant of honor , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he’s a sliver of the almighty himself—and is the closest thing to a god we have left END_TOKEN
oh , i’m not objecting , navani said END_TOKEN
i’d let a confused dishwasher marry us END_TOKEN
i just think it’s a little unusual END_TOKEN
it’s the best we’re going to get , assuming he is willing END_TOKEN
he looked to navani , then raised his eyebrows and shrugged END_TOKEN
he rested his hand on the back of her head , touching her black hair , which she had left loose END_TOKEN
no , i don’t think that i could END_TOKEN
i don’t think that any man has ever had a chance better than this END_TOKEN
she smiled , and her only reply was a kiss END_TOKEN
dalinar was surprisingly nervous as , several hours later , he rode one of urithiru’s strange fabrial lifts toward the roof of the tower END_TOKEN
the lift resembled a balcony , one of many that lined a vast open shaft in the middle of urithiru—a columnar space as wide as a ballroom , which stretched up from the first floor to the last one END_TOKEN
the tiers of the city , despite looking circular from the front , were actually more half - circles , with the flat sides facing east END_TOKEN
the edges of the lower levels melded into the mountains to either side , but the very center was open to the east END_TOKEN
the rooms up against that flat side had windows there , providing a view toward the origin END_TOKEN
and here , in this central shaft , those windows made up one wall END_TOKEN
a pure , single unbroken pane of glass hundreds of feet tall END_TOKEN
in the day , that lit the shaft with brilliant sunlight END_TOKEN
now , it was dark with the gloom of night END_TOKEN
the balcony crawled steadily along a vertical trench in the wall ; adolin and renarin rode with him , along with a few guards and shallan davar END_TOKEN
the group stood on the other side of the balcony , giving him space to think END_TOKEN
he could hardly keep his hands from shaking END_TOKEN
you’d think he was some silk - covered virgin , not a general well into his middle years END_TOKEN
he felt a rumbling deep within him END_TOKEN
the stormfather was being responsive at the moment , for which he was grateful END_TOKEN
i’m surprised , dalinar whispered to the spren , you agreed to this so willingly END_TOKEN
i respect all oaths , the stormfather responded END_TOKEN
made in haste , or in ignorance END_TOKEN
all are the mark of men and true spren over beasts and subspren END_TOKEN
the mark of intelligence , free will , and choice END_TOKEN
dalinar chewed on that , and found he was not surprised by the extreme opinion END_TOKEN
spren should be extreme ; they were forces of nature END_TOKEN
but was this how honor himself , the almighty , had thought END_TOKEN
the balcony ground its inexorable way toward the top of the tower END_TOKEN
only a handful of the dozens of lifts worked ; back when urithiru flourished , they all would have been going at once END_TOKEN
they passed level after level of unexplored space , which bothered dalinar END_TOKEN
making this his fortress was like camping in an unknown land END_TOKEN
the lift finally reached the top floor , and his guards scrambled to open the gates END_TOKEN
those were from bridge thirteen these days—he’d assigned bridge four to other responsibilities , considering them too important for simple guard duty , now that they were close to becoming radiants END_TOKEN
increasingly anxious , dalinar led the way past several pillars designed with representations of the orders of radiants END_TOKEN
a set of steps took him up through a trapdoor onto the very roof of the tower END_TOKEN
although each tier was smaller than the one below it , this roof was still over a hundred yards wide END_TOKEN
it was cold up here , but someone had set up braziers for warmth and torches for light END_TOKEN
the night was strikingly clear , and high above , starspren swirled and made distant patterns END_TOKEN
dalinar wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that no one—not even his sons—had questioned him when he’d announced his intent to marry in the middle of the night , on the roof of the tower END_TOKEN
he searched out navani , and was shocked to see that she’d found a traditional bridal crown END_TOKEN
the intricate headdress of jade and turquoise complemented her wedding gown END_TOKEN
red for luck , it was embroidered with gold and shaped in a much looser style than the havah , with wide sleeves and a graceful drape END_TOKEN
should dalinar have found something more traditional to wear himself END_TOKEN
he suddenly felt like a dusty , empty frame hung beside the gorgeous painting that was navani in her wedding regalia END_TOKEN
elhokar stiffly stood at her side wearing a formal golden coat and loose takama underskirt END_TOKEN
he was paler than normal , following the failed assassination attempt during the weeping , where he’d nearly bled to death END_TOKEN
he’d been resting a great deal lately END_TOKEN
though they’d decided to forgo the extravagance of a traditional alethi wedding , they had invited some others END_TOKEN
brightlord aladar and his daughter , sebarial and his mistress END_TOKEN
kalami and teshav to act as witnesses END_TOKEN
he felt relieved to see them there—he’d feared navani would be unable to find women willing to notarize the wedding END_TOKEN
a smattering of dalinar’s officers and scribes filled out the small procession END_TOKEN
at the very back of the crowd gathered between the braziers , he spotted a surprising face END_TOKEN
kadash , the ardent , had come as requested END_TOKEN
his scarred , bearded face didn’t look pleased , but he had come END_TOKEN
perhaps with everything else happening in the world , a highprince marrying his widowed sister - in - law wouldn’t cause too much of a stir END_TOKEN
dalinar stepped up to navani and took her hands , one shrouded in a sleeve , the other warm to his touch END_TOKEN
you look amazing , he said END_TOKEN
dalinar looked to elhokar , who bowed his head to dalinar END_TOKEN
this will further muddy the relationship between us , dalinar thought , reading the same sentiment on his nephew’s features END_TOKEN
gavilar would not appreciate how his son had been handled END_TOKEN
despite his best intentions , dalinar had trodden down the boy and seized power END_TOKEN
elhokar’s time recuperating had worsened the situation , as dalinar had grown accustomed to making decisions on his own END_TOKEN
however , dalinar would be lying to himself if he said that was where it had begun END_TOKEN
his actions had been done for the good of alethkar , for the good of roshar itself , but that didn’t deny the fact that—step by step—he’d usurped the throne , despite claiming all along he had no intention of doing so END_TOKEN
dalinar let go of navani with one hand and rested it on his nephew’s shoulder END_TOKEN
i’m sorry , son , he said END_TOKEN
you always are , uncle , elhokar said END_TOKEN
it doesn’t stop you , but i don’t suppose that it should END_TOKEN
your life is defined by deciding what you want , then seizing it END_TOKEN
the rest of us could learn from that , if only we could figure out how to keep up END_TOKEN
i have things to discuss with you END_TOKEN
but for tonight , i simply ask your blessing , if you can find it to give END_TOKEN
this will make my mother happy , elhokar said END_TOKEN
elhokar kissed his mother on the forehead , then left them , striding across the rooftop END_TOKEN
at first dalinar worried the king would stalk down below , but he stopped beside one of the more distant braziers , warming his hands END_TOKEN
the only one missing is your spren , dalinar END_TOKEN
a strong breeze struck the top of the tower , carrying with it the scent of recent rainfall , of wet stone and broken branches END_TOKEN
navani gasped , pulling against dalinar END_TOKEN
a presence emerged in the sky END_TOKEN
the stormfather encompassed everything , a face that stretched to both horizons , regarding the men imperiously END_TOKEN
the air became strangely still , and everything but the tower’s top seemed to fade END_TOKEN
it was as if they had slipped into a place outside of time itself END_TOKEN
lighteyes and guards alike murmured or cried out END_TOKEN
even dalinar , who had been expecting this , found himself taking a step backward—and he had to fight the urge to cringe down before the spren END_TOKEN
oaths , the stormfather rumbled , are the soul of righteousness END_TOKEN
if you are to survive the coming tempest , oaths must guide you END_TOKEN
i am comfortable with oaths , stormfather , dalinar called up to him END_TOKEN
the first in millennia to bind me END_TOKEN
somehow , dalinar felt the spren’s attention shifting to navani END_TOKEN
do oaths hold meaning to you END_TOKEN
the right oaths , navani said END_TOKEN
and your oath to this man END_TOKEN
i swear it to him , and to you , and any who care to listen END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin is mine , and i am his END_TOKEN
all people have , navani said , unbowed END_TOKEN
this one i will not break END_TOKEN
the stormfather seemed content with this , though it was far from a traditional alethi wedding oath END_TOKEN
i swear it likewise , dalinar said , holding to her END_TOKEN
navani kholin is mine , and i am hers END_TOKEN
dalinar had anticipated thunder , lightning , some kind of celestial trump of victory END_TOKEN
all through the gathered guests , smoky blue awespren rings burst out above heads END_TOKEN
instead she was ringed by gloryspren , the golden lights rotating above her head END_TOKEN
nearby , sebarial rubbed his temple—as if trying to understand what he’d seen END_TOKEN
dalinar’s new guards sagged , looking suddenly exhausted END_TOKEN
adolin , being adolin , let out a whoop END_TOKEN
he ran over , trailing joyspren in the shape of blue leaves that hurried to keep up with him END_TOKEN
renarin followed , more reserved but—judging from the wide grin on his face—equally pleased END_TOKEN
the next part became a blur , shaking hands , speaking words of thanks END_TOKEN
insisting that no gifts were needed , as they’d skipped that part of the traditional ceremony END_TOKEN
it seemed that the stormfather’s pronouncement had been dramatic enough that everyone accepted it END_TOKEN
even elhokar , despite his earlier pique , gave his mother a hug and dalinar a clasp on the shoulder before going below END_TOKEN
the ardent waited to the end END_TOKEN
he stood with hands clasped before him as the rooftop emptied END_TOKEN
to dalinar , kadash had always looked wrong in those robes END_TOKEN
though he wore the traditional squared beard , it was not an ardent that dalinar saw END_TOKEN
it was a soldier , with a lean build , dangerous posture , and keen light violet eyes END_TOKEN
he had a twisting old scar running up to and around the top of his shaved head END_TOKEN
kadash’s life might now be one of peace and service , but his youth had been spent at war END_TOKEN
dalinar whispered a few words of promise to navani , and she left him to go to the level below , where she’d ordered food and wine to be set up END_TOKEN
dalinar stepped over to kadash , confident END_TOKEN
the pleasure of having finally done what he’d postponed for so long surged through him END_TOKEN
this was a joy that he’d assumed lost to him since his youth , an outcome he hadn’t even allowed himself to dream would be his END_TOKEN
he would not apologize for it , or for her END_TOKEN
i wish i could only be here as an old friend , kadash said softly END_TOKEN
i have to report this , dalinar END_TOKEN
the ardentia will not be pleased END_TOKEN
surely they cannot deny my marriage if the stormfather himself blessed the union END_TOKEN
you expect us to accept the authority of a spren END_TOKEN
dalinar , that’s blasphemy , kadash said , voice pained END_TOKEN
memories of what we did together , dalinar END_TOKEN
i appreciate the man you have become ; you should avoid reminding me of the man you once were END_TOKEN
dalinar paused , and a memory swirled up from the depths inside him—one he hadn’t thought of in years END_TOKEN
he remembered kadash , bloodied , kneeling on the ground having retched until his stomach was empty END_TOKEN
a hardened soldier who had encountered something so vile that even he was shaken END_TOKEN
he’d left to become an ardent the next day END_TOKEN
dark times need not be dredged up , kadash said END_TOKEN
this isn’t about… that day , dalinar END_TOKEN
it’s about today , and what you’ve been spreading among the scribes END_TOKEN
talk of these things you’ve seen in visions END_TOKEN
holy messages , dalinar said , feeling cold END_TOKEN
holy messages claiming the almighty is dead END_TOKEN
arriving on the eve of the return of the voidbringers END_TOKEN
dalinar , can’t you see how this looks END_TOKEN
i’m your ardent , technically your slave END_TOKEN
and yes , perhaps still your friend END_TOKEN
i’ve tried to explain to the councils in kharbranth and jah keved that you mean well END_TOKEN
i tell the ardents of the holy enclave that you’re looking back toward when the knights radiant were pure , rather than their eventual corruption END_TOKEN
i tell them that you have no control over these visions END_TOKEN
but dalinar , that was before you started teaching that the almighty was dead END_TOKEN
they’re angry enough over that , and now you’ve gone and defied convention , spitting in the eyes of the ardents END_TOKEN
i personally don’t think it matters if you marry navani END_TOKEN
that prohibition is outdated to be sure END_TOKEN
dalinar reached to place a hand on kadash’s shoulder , but the man pulled away END_TOKEN
old friend , dalinar said softly , honor might be dead , but i have felt… something else END_TOKEN
it is not that god has died , it is that the almighty was never god END_TOKEN
he did his best to guide us , but he was an impostor END_TOKEN
a being not unlike a spren—he had the power of a god , but not the pedigree END_TOKEN
kadash looked at him , eyes widening END_TOKEN
don’t ever repeat what you just said END_TOKEN
i think i can explain away what happened tonight END_TOKEN
but you don’t seem to realize you’re aboard a ship barely afloat in a storm , while you insist on doing a jig on the prow END_TOKEN
i will not hold back truth if i find it , kadash , dalinar said END_TOKEN
you just saw that i am literally bound to a spren of oaths END_TOKEN
i don’t think you would lie , dalinar , kadash said END_TOKEN
but i do think you can make mistakes END_TOKEN
do not forget that i was there END_TOKEN
dalinar thought as kadash backed up , bowed , then turned and left END_TOKEN
what does he remember that i cannot END_TOKEN
finally , he shook his head , and went to join the midnight feast , intent on being done with it as soon as was seemly END_TOKEN
i can point to the moment when i decided for certain this record had to be written END_TOKEN
i hung between realms , seeing into shadesmar—the realm of the spren—and beyond END_TOKEN
kaladin trudged through a field of quiet rockbuds , fully aware that he was too late to prevent a disaster END_TOKEN
his failure pressed down on him with an almost physical sensation , like the weight of a bridge he was forced to carry all on his own END_TOKEN
after so long in the eastern part of the stormlands , he had nearly forgotten the sights of a fertile landscape END_TOKEN
rockbuds here grew almost as big as barrels , with vines as thick as his wrist spilling out and lapping water from the pools on the stone END_TOKEN
fields of vibrant green grass pulled back into burrows before him , easily three feet tall when standing at height END_TOKEN
the field was dappled with glowing lifespren , like motes of green dust END_TOKEN
the grass back near the shattered plains had barely reached as high as his ankle , and had mostly grown in yellowish patches on the leeward side of hills END_TOKEN
he was surprised to find that he distrusted this taller , fuller grass END_TOKEN
an ambusher could hide in that , by crouching down and waiting for the grass to rise back up END_TOKEN
he’d run through fields like this playing catch - me with his brother , trying to see who was quick enough to grab handfuls of grass before it hid END_TOKEN
four days ago , he’d traveled by oathgate to the shattered plains , then flown to the northwest at speed END_TOKEN
filled to bursting with stormlight—and carrying a wealth more in gemstones—he’d been determined to reach his home , hearthstone , before the everstorm returned END_TOKEN
after just half a day , he’d run out of stormlight somewhere in aladar’s princedom END_TOKEN
perhaps he could have flown all the way to hearthstone if he’d been more practiced with his powers END_TOKEN
as it was , he’d traveled over a thousand miles in half a day , but this last bit—ninety or so miles—had taken an excruciating three days END_TOKEN
it had arrived earlier in the day around noon END_TOKEN
kaladin noticed a bit of debris peeking out of the grass , and he trudged toward it END_TOKEN
the foliage obligingly pulled back before him , revealing a broken wooden churn , the kind used for turning sow’s milk into butter END_TOKEN
kaladin crouched and rested fingers on the splintered wood , then glanced toward another chunk of wood peeking out over the tops of the grass END_TOKEN
syl zipped down as a ribbon of light , passing his head and spinning around the length of wood END_TOKEN
it’s the edge of a roof , kaladin said END_TOKEN
the lip that hangs down on the leeward side of a building END_TOKEN
probably from a storage shed , judging by the other debris END_TOKEN
alethkar wasn’t in the harshest of the stormlands , but neither was this some soft - skinned western land END_TOKEN
buildings here were built low and squat , sturdy sides pointed eastward toward the origin , like the shoulder of a man set and ready to take the force of an impact END_TOKEN
windows would only be on the leeward—the westward—side END_TOKEN
like the grass and the trees , humankind had learned to weather the storms END_TOKEN
that depended on storms always blowing in the same direction END_TOKEN
kaladin had done what he could to prepare the villages and towns he passed for the coming everstorm , which would blow in the wrong direction and transform parshmen into destructive voidbringers END_TOKEN
nobody in those towns had possessed working spanreeds , however , and he’d been unable to contact his home END_TOKEN
earlier today , he’d spent the everstorm within a tomb he’d hollowed out of rock using his shardblade—syl herself , who could manifest as any weapon he desired END_TOKEN
in truth , the storm hadn’t been nearly as bad as the one where he’d fought the assassin in white END_TOKEN
but the debris he found here proved that this one had been bad enough END_TOKEN
the mere memory of that red storm outside his hollow made panic rise inside him END_TOKEN
the everstorm was so wrong , so unnatural—like a baby born with no face END_TOKEN
some things just should not be END_TOKEN
he stood up and continued on his way END_TOKEN
he had changed uniforms before leaving—his old uniform had been bloodied and tattered END_TOKEN
he now wore a spare generic kholin uniform END_TOKEN
it felt wrong not to bear the symbol of bridge four END_TOKEN
he crested a hill and spotted a river to his right END_TOKEN
trees sprouted along its banks , hungry for the extra water END_TOKEN
so if he looked directly west…
hand shading his eyes , he could see hills that had been stripped of grass and rockbuds END_TOKEN
they’d soon be slathered with seed - crem , and lavis polyps would start to bud END_TOKEN
that hadn’t started yet ; this was supposed to be the weeping END_TOKEN
rain should be falling right now in a constant , gentle shower END_TOKEN
syl zipped up in front of him , a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
your eyes are brown again , she noted END_TOKEN
it took a few hours without summoning his shardblade END_TOKEN
once he did that , his eyes would bleed to a glassy light blue , almost glowing END_TOKEN
syl found the variation fascinating ; kaladin still hadn’t decided how he felt about it END_TOKEN
we’re close , kaladin said , pointing END_TOKEN
we’re maybe two hours from hearthstone END_TOKEN
syl said , her ribbon of light spiraling and taking the shape of a young woman in a flowing havah , tight and buttoning above the waist , with safehand covered END_TOKEN
kaladin grunted , walking down the slope , longing for stormlight END_TOKEN
being without it now , after holding so much , was an echoing hollowness within him END_TOKEN
was this what it would be like every time he ran dry END_TOKEN
the everstorm hadn’t recharged his spheres , of course END_TOKEN
neither with stormlight nor some other energy , which he’d feared might happen END_TOKEN
do you like the new dress END_TOKEN
syl asked , wagging her covered safehand as she stood in the air END_TOKEN
i’ll have you know i put a ton of thought into it END_TOKEN
i spent positively hours thinking of just how—oh END_TOKEN
she turned into a little stormcloud that shot toward a lurg clinging to a stone END_TOKEN
she inspected the fist - size amphibian on one side , then the other , before squealing in joy and turning into a perfect imitation of the thing—except pale white - blue END_TOKEN
this startled the creature away , and she giggled , zipping back toward kaladin as a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
she asked , forming into a young woman and resting on his shoulder END_TOKEN
i’m sure i was scolding you END_TOKEN
oh , yes , you’re home END_TOKEN
sometimes , for all her curiosity , she could be oblivious END_TOKEN
but… it’s your home… syl said END_TOKEN
the everstorm , syl , kaladin said END_TOKEN
we were supposed to beat it here END_TOKEN
he’d needed to beat it here END_TOKEN
surely someone would have survived , right END_TOKEN
the fury of the storm , and then the worse fury after END_TOKEN
the murderous rampage of servants turned into monsters END_TOKEN
he forced himself into a double march again , pack slung over his shoulder END_TOKEN
the weight was still heavy , dreadfully so , but he found that he had to know END_TOKEN
someone had to witness what had happened to his home END_TOKEN
the rain resumed about an hour out of hearthstone , so at least the weather patterns hadn’t been completely ruined END_TOKEN
unfortunately , this meant he had to hike the rest of the way wet END_TOKEN
he splashed through puddles where rainspren grew , blue candles with eyes on the very tip END_TOKEN
it will be all right , kaladin , syl promised from his shoulder END_TOKEN
she’d created an umbrella for herself , and still wore the traditional vorin dress instead of her usual girlish skirt END_TOKEN
the sky had darkened by the time he finally crested the last lavis hill and looked down on hearthstone END_TOKEN
he braced himself for the destruction , but it shocked him nonetheless END_TOKEN
some of the buildings he remembered were simply… gone END_TOKEN
he couldn’t see the entire town from his vantage , not in the gloom of the weeping , but many of the structures he could make out were hollow and ruined END_TOKEN
he stood for a long time as night fell END_TOKEN
he didn’t spot a glimmer of light in the town END_TOKEN
a part of him scrunched up inside , huddling into a corner , tired of being whipped so often END_TOKEN
he’d embraced his power ; he’d taken the path of a radiant END_TOKEN
his eyes immediately sought out his own home on the outskirts of town END_TOKEN
even if he’d been able to see it in the rainy evening gloom , he didn’t want to go there END_TOKEN
he couldn’t face the death he might find END_TOKEN
instead , he rounded hearthstone on the northwestern side , where a hill led up to the citylord’s manor END_TOKEN
the larger rural towns like this served as a kind of hub for the small farming communities around them END_TOKEN
because of that , hearthstone was cursed with the presence of a lighteyed ruler of some status END_TOKEN
brightlord roshone , a man whose greedy ways had ruined far more than one life END_TOKEN
moash… kaladin thought as he trudged up the hill toward the manor , shivering in the chill and the darkness END_TOKEN
he’d have to face his friend’s betrayal—and near assassination of elhokar—at some point END_TOKEN
for now , he had more pressing wounds that needed tending END_TOKEN
the manor was where the town’s parshmen had been kept ; they’d have begun their rampage here END_TOKEN
he was pretty sure that if he ran across roshone’s broken corpse , he wouldn’t be too heartbroken END_TOKEN
kaladin looked up and noted an unusual spren whipping about END_TOKEN
long , grey , like a tattered streamer of cloth in the wind END_TOKEN
it wound around him , fluttering END_TOKEN
he’d seen its like only once or twice before END_TOKEN
people feel gloomy all the time END_TOKEN
i’m pretty sure one of my aunts liked to hunt these things END_TOKEN
like , try to spot them END_TOKEN
can’t remember her name… syl cocked her head , oblivious to the fact that rain was falling through her form END_TOKEN
just an honorspren i referred to that way END_TOKEN
more seems to be coming back to you END_TOKEN
the longer i’m with you , the more it happens END_TOKEN
assuming you don’t try to kill me again END_TOKEN
she gave him a sideways look END_TOKEN
though it was dark , she glowed enough for him to make out the expression END_TOKEN
how often are you going to make me apologize for that END_TOKEN
how many times have i done it so far END_TOKEN
it was light , coming from the manor house END_TOKEN
no , it seemed to be candles or lanterns inside END_TOKEN
someone , it appeared , had survived END_TOKEN
he needed to be careful , though as he approached , he found that he didn’t want to be END_TOKEN
he wanted to be reckless , angry , destructive END_TOKEN
if he found the creatures that had taken his home from him…
be ready , he mumbled to syl END_TOKEN
he stepped off the pathway , which was kept free of rockbuds and other plants , and crept carefully toward the manor END_TOKEN
light shone between boards that had been pounded across the building’s windows , replacing glass that the everstorm undoubtedly broke END_TOKEN
he was surprised the manor had survived as well as it had END_TOKEN
the porch had been ripped free , but the roof remained END_TOKEN
the rain masked other sounds and made it difficult to see much beyond that , but someone , or something , was inside END_TOKEN
shadows moved in front of the lights END_TOKEN
heart pounding , kaladin rounded toward the northern side of the building END_TOKEN
the servants’ entrance would be here , along with the quarters for the parshmen END_TOKEN
an unusual amount of noise came from inside the manor house END_TOKEN
like a nest full of rats END_TOKEN
he had to feel his way through the gardens END_TOKEN
the parshmen had been housed in a small structure built in the manor’s shadow , with a single open chamber and benches for sleeping END_TOKEN
kaladin reached it by touch and felt at a large hole ripped in the side END_TOKEN
kaladin spun as the back door of the manor opened , its warped frame grinding against stone END_TOKEN
he dove for cover behind a shalebark mound , but light bathed him , cutting through the rain END_TOKEN
kaladin stretched his hand to the side , prepared to summon syl , yet the person who stepped from the manor was no voidbringer , but instead a human guardsman in an old helm spotted by rust END_TOKEN
the man held up his lantern END_TOKEN
here now , he shouted at kaladin , fumbling at the mace on his belt END_TOKEN
he pulled free the weapon and held it out in a quivering hand END_TOKEN
come here into the light and let me see you END_TOKEN
he didn’t recognize the soldier—but either someone had survived the voidbringer assault , or this man was part of an expedition investigating the aftermath END_TOKEN
either way , it was the first hopeful sign kaladin had seen since arriving END_TOKEN
he held his hands up—he was unarmed save for syl—and let the guard bully him into the building END_TOKEN
i thought that i was surely dead END_TOKEN
certainly , some who saw further than i did thought i had fallen END_TOKEN
kaladin stepped into roshone’s manor , and his apocalyptic visions of death and loss started to fade as he recognized people END_TOKEN
he passed toravi , one of the town’s many farmers , in the hallway END_TOKEN
kaladin remembered the man as being enormous , with thick shoulders END_TOKEN
in actuality , he was shorter than kaladin by half a hand , and most of bridge four could have outmatched him for muscles END_TOKEN
toravi didn’t seem to recognize kaladin END_TOKEN
the man stepped into a side chamber , which was packed with darkeyes sitting on the floor END_TOKEN
the soldier walked kaladin along the candlelit hallway END_TOKEN
they passed through the kitchens , and kaladin noted dozens of other familiar faces END_TOKEN
the townspeople filled the manor , packing every room END_TOKEN
most sat on the floor in family groups , and while they looked tired and disheveled , they were alive END_TOKEN
had they rebuffed the voidbringer assault , then END_TOKEN
my parents , kaladin thought , pushing through a small group of townspeople and moving more quickly END_TOKEN
said the soldier behind , grabbing kaladin by the shoulder END_TOKEN
he shoved his mace into the small of kaladin’s back END_TOKEN
don’t make me down you , son END_TOKEN
kaladin turned on the guardsman , a clean - shaven fellow with brown eyes that seemed set a little too close together END_TOKEN
that rusted cap was a disgrace END_TOKEN
now , the soldier said , we’re just going to go find brightlord roshone , and you’re going to explain why you were skulking round the place END_TOKEN
act real nice , and maybe he won’t hang you END_TOKEN
the townspeople in the kitchens noticed kaladin finally , and pulled away END_TOKEN
many whispered to one another , eyes wide , fearful END_TOKEN
he heard the words deserter , slave brands , dangerous END_TOKEN
syl asked as she walked across a kitchen countertop END_TOKEN
why would they recognize this man he had become END_TOKEN
kaladin saw himself reflected in a pan hanging beside the brick oven END_TOKEN
long hair with a curl to it , the tips resting against his shoulders END_TOKEN
a rough uniform that was a shade too small for him , face bearing a scruffy beard from several weeks without shaving END_TOKEN
soaked and exhausted , he looked like a vagabond END_TOKEN
this wasn’t the homecoming he’d imagined during his first months at war END_TOKEN
a glorious reunion where he returned as a hero wearing the knots of a sergeant , his brother delivered safe to his family END_TOKEN
in his fancies , people had praised him , slapped him on the back and accepted him END_TOKEN
these people had never treated him or his family with any measure of kindness END_TOKEN
let’s go , the soldier said , shoving him on the shoulder END_TOKEN
when the man shoved harder , kaladin rolled his body with the push , and the shift of weight sent the guard stumbling past him END_TOKEN
the guard hesitated , then took a step back and gripped his mace more firmly END_TOKEN
wow , syl said , zipping up to kaladin’s shoulder END_TOKEN
old sergeant’s trick , kaladin whispered , turning and leaving the kitchens END_TOKEN
the guard followed behind , barking an order that kaladin ignored END_TOKEN
each step through this manor was like walking through a memory END_TOKEN
there was the dining nook where he’d confronted rillir and laral on the night he’d discovered his father was a thief END_TOKEN
this hallway beyond , hung with portraits of people he didn’t know , had been where he’d played as a child END_TOKEN
he’d have to talk to his parents about tien END_TOKEN
it was why he hadn’t tried to contact them after being freed from slavery END_TOKEN
storms , he hoped they lived END_TOKEN
soft , underneath the sounds of people talking , still he picked it out END_TOKEN
he asked , turning on his guard END_TOKEN
kaladin ignored him and strode down the hallway , syl flying along beside his head END_TOKEN
kaladin shoved past people , following the sounds of the tormented , and eventually stumbled into the doorway of the parlor END_TOKEN
it had been transformed into a surgeon’s triage room , with mats laid out on the floor bearing wounded END_TOKEN
a figure knelt by one of the pallets carefully splinting a broken arm END_TOKEN
kaladin had known as soon as he’d heard those moans of pain where he’d find his father END_TOKEN
kaladin’s father looked weathered , bags underneath his dark brown eyes END_TOKEN
the hair was greyer than kaladin remembered , the face gaunter END_TOKEN
balding , diminutive , thin , bespectacled… and amazing END_TOKEN
lirin asked , turning back to his work END_TOKEN
did the highprince’s house send soldiers already END_TOKEN
we can certainly use… lirin hesitated , then looked back at kaladin END_TOKEN
hello , father , kaladin said END_TOKEN
the guardsman finally caught up , shouldering past gawking townspeople and waving his mace toward kaladin like a baton END_TOKEN
kaladin sidestepped absently , then pushed the man so he stumbled farther down the hallway END_TOKEN
it is you , lirin said END_TOKEN
then he scrambled over and caught kaladin in an embrace END_TOKEN
kaladin’s mother appeared in the doorway a moment later , bearing a tray of freshly boiled bandages END_TOKEN
she probably thought that lirin needed her help with a patient END_TOKEN
taller than her husband by a few fingers , she wore her hair tied back with a kerchief just as kaladin remembered END_TOKEN
she raised her gloved safehand to her lips , gaping , and the tray slipped down in her other hand , tumbling bandages to the floor END_TOKEN
shockspren , like pale yellow triangles breaking and re - forming , appeared behind her END_TOKEN
she dropped the tray and reached to the side of kaladin’s face with a soft touch END_TOKEN
syl zipped around in a ribbon of light , laughing END_TOKEN
not until it had been said END_TOKEN
he took a deep breath , choked on it the first time , then finally forced it out END_TOKEN
i’m sorry , father , mother , he whispered END_TOKEN
i joined the army to protect him , but i could barely protect myself END_TOKEN
he found himself shaking , and he put his back to the wall , letting himself sink down until he was seated END_TOKEN
oh , kaladin , hesina said , kneeling down beside him and pulling him into an embrace END_TOKEN
we got your letter , but over a year ago they told us you had died as well END_TOKEN
i should have saved him , kaladin whispered END_TOKEN
you shouldn’t have gone in the first place , lirin said END_TOKEN
but now… almighty , now you’re back END_TOKEN
lirin stood up , tears leaking down his cheeks END_TOKEN
a short time later , kaladin sat among the wounded , holding a cup of warm soup in his hands END_TOKEN
he hadn’t had a hot meal since… when END_TOKEN
that’s obviously a slave’s brand , lirin , a soldier said , speaking with kaladin’s father near the doorway into the room END_TOKEN
sas glyph , so it happened here in the princedom END_TOKEN
they probably told you he’d died to save you the shame of the truth END_TOKEN
and then the shash brand—you don’t get that for mere insubordination END_TOKEN
his mother knelt beside him , one hand on his shoulder , protective END_TOKEN
boiled vegetable broth with steamed lavis stirred in , spiced as his mother always made it END_TOKEN
he hadn’t spoken much in the half hour since he’d arrived END_TOKEN
for now , he just wanted to be here with them END_TOKEN
strangely , his memories had turned fond END_TOKEN
he remembered tien laughing , brightening the dreariest of days END_TOKEN
he remembered hours spent studying medicine with his father , or cleaning with his mother END_TOKEN
syl hovered before his mother , still wearing her little havah , invisible to everyone but kaladin END_TOKEN
the spren had a perplexed look on her face END_TOKEN
the wrong - way highstorm did break many of the town’s buildings , hesina explained to him softly END_TOKEN
we had to dedicate your spot to something else , kal , but we can make space for you END_TOKEN
captain of roshone’s guard ; kaladin thought he remembered the man END_TOKEN
he almost seemed too pretty to be a soldier , but then , he was lighteyed END_TOKEN
don’t worry about that , hesina said END_TOKEN
we’ll deal with it , whatever the… trouble is END_TOKEN
with all these wounded pouring in from the villages around , roshone will need your father’s skill END_TOKEN
roshone won’t go making a storm and risk lirin’s discontent—and you won’t be taken from us again END_TOKEN
she talked to him as if he were a child END_TOKEN
what a surreal sensation , being back here , being treated like he was still the boy who had left for war five years ago END_TOKEN
three men bearing their son’s name had lived and died in that time END_TOKEN
the soldier who had been forged in amaram’s army END_TOKEN
the slave , so bitter and angry END_TOKEN
his parents had never met captain kaladin , bodyguard to the most powerful man in roshar END_TOKEN
and then… there was the next man , the man he was becoming END_TOKEN
a man who owned the skies and spoke ancient oaths END_TOKEN
he’s a runaway slave , the guard captain hissed END_TOKEN
we can’t just ignore that , surgeon END_TOKEN
and even if for some reason he was allowed to hold a spear despite his brands , he’s a deserter END_TOKEN
look at those haunted eyes and tell me you don’t see a man who has done terrible things END_TOKEN
he’s my son , lirin said END_TOKEN
i’ll buy his writ of slavery END_TOKEN
tell roshone he can either let this slide , or he can go without a surgeon END_TOKEN
unless he assumes mara can take over after just a few years of apprenticeship END_TOKEN
did they think they were speaking softly enough that he couldn’t hear END_TOKEN
look at the wounded people in this room , kaladin END_TOKEN
this was not the aftermath of a battle , but of a natural disaster END_TOKEN
so what had happened to the voidbringers END_TOKEN
things have gotten better since you left , hesina promised kaladin , squeezing his shoulder END_TOKEN
roshone isn’t as bad as he once was END_TOKEN
we can rebuild , be a family again END_TOKEN
and there’s something else you need to know about END_TOKEN
hesina , lirin said , throwing his hands into the air END_TOKEN
write a letter to the highprince’s administrators , lirin said END_TOKEN
explain the situation ; see if we can get a forbearance , or at least an explanation END_TOKEN
we can wait upon a higher authority , and in the meantime i can have my son back END_TOKEN
we’ll see , the soldier said , folding his arms END_TOKEN
i’m not sure how much i like the idea of a shash - branded man running around my town END_TOKEN
the two had a hushed exchange as the guard settled back against the doorway , pointedly keeping an eye on kaladin END_TOKEN
did he know how little like a soldier he looked END_TOKEN
he didn’t walk like a man acquainted with battle END_TOKEN
he stepped too hard , and stood with his knees too straight END_TOKEN
there were no dents in his breastplate , and his sword’s scabbard knocked against things as he turned END_TOKEN
was it any wonder that his parents still thought of him as a child END_TOKEN
he’d come in looking ragged and abandoned , then had started sobbing about tien’s death END_TOKEN
being home brought out the child in him , it seemed END_TOKEN
perhaps it was time , for once , to stop letting the rain dictate his mood END_TOKEN
he couldn’t banish the seed of darkness inside him , but stormfather , he didn’t need to let it rule him either END_TOKEN
syl walked up to him in the air END_TOKEN
syl , you never knew me when
so how can you remember them END_TOKEN
because i do , syl said , flitting around him END_TOKEN
i didn’t know you then , but the winds did , and i am of the winds END_TOKEN
the winds are of honor , she said , laughing as if he’d said something ridiculous END_TOKEN
and you don’t have an imagination , it appears END_TOKEN
she landed in the air before him and became a young woman END_TOKEN
besides , there was… another voice END_TOKEN
pure , with a song like tapped crystal , distant yet demanding… she smiled , and zipped away END_TOKEN
well , the world might have been upended , but syl was as impenetrable as ever END_TOKEN
kaladin set aside his soup and climbed to his feet END_TOKEN
he stretched to one side , then the other , feeling satisfying pops from his joints END_TOKEN
storms , but everyone in this town seemed smaller than he remembered END_TOKEN
he hadn’t been that much shorter when he’d left hearthstone , had he END_TOKEN
a figure stood right outside the room , speaking with the guard with the rusty helmet END_TOKEN
roshone wore a lighteyes’ coat that was several seasons out of fashion—adolin would have shaken his head at that END_TOKEN
the citylord wore a wooden foot on his right leg , and had lost weight since kaladin had last seen him END_TOKEN
his skin drooped on his figure like melted wax , bunching up at his neck END_TOKEN
that said , roshone had the same imperious bearing , the same angry expression—his light yellow eyes seemed to blame everyone and everything in this insignificant town for his banishment END_TOKEN
he’d once lived in kholinar , but had been involved in the deaths of some citizens—moash’s grandparents—and had been shipped out here as punishment END_TOKEN
he turned toward kaladin , lit by candles on the walls END_TOKEN
they didn’t teach you to keep yourself in the army , i see END_TOKEN
let me have a look at those brands of yours END_TOKEN
he reached over and held up the hair in front of kaladin’s forehead END_TOKEN
he bashed roshone right in the face END_TOKEN
a solid hit , exactly like hav had taught him END_TOKEN
thumb outside of his fist , he connected with the first two knuckles of his hand across roshone’s cheekbone , then followed through to slide across the front of the face END_TOKEN
rarely had he delivered such a perfect punch END_TOKEN
it barely even hurt his fist END_TOKEN
roshone dropped like a felled tree END_TOKEN
that , kaladin said , was for my friend moash END_TOKEN
lirin exclaimed , grabbing him by the shoulder END_TOKEN
what are you doing , son END_TOKEN
roshone sputtered on the ground , his nose bleeding END_TOKEN
syl landed on kaladin’s shoulder , hands on her hips END_TOKEN
the darkeyed guard scrambled to help roshone to his feet while the captain leveled his sword at kaladin END_TOKEN
a third joined them , running in from another room END_TOKEN
kaladin stepped one foot back , falling into a guard position END_TOKEN
roshone demanded , holding his handkerchief to his nose END_TOKEN
angerspren boiled up from the ground in pools END_TOKEN
please , no , kaladin’s mother cried , clinging to lirin END_TOKEN
kaladin held out a hand toward her , palm forward , in a quieting motion END_TOKEN
that was only payment for a little unsettled debt between roshone and me END_TOKEN
he met the eyes of the guards , each in turn , and they shuffled uncertainly END_TOKEN
unexpectedly , kaladin felt in complete control of the situation—and… well , more than a little embarrassed END_TOKEN
suddenly , the perspective of it crashed down on him END_TOKEN
since leaving hearthstone , kaladin had met true evil , and roshone hardly compared END_TOKEN
hadn’t he sworn to protect even those he didn’t like END_TOKEN
wasn’t the whole point of what he had learned to keep him from doing things like this END_TOKEN
he glanced at syl , and she nodded to him END_TOKEN
for a short time , it had been nice to just be kal again END_TOKEN
fortunately , he wasn’t that youth any longer END_TOKEN
he was a new person—and for the first time in a long , long while , he was happy with that person END_TOKEN
stand down , men , kaladin said to the soldiers END_TOKEN
i promise not to hit your brightlord again END_TOKEN
i apologize for that ; i was momentarily distracted by our previous history END_TOKEN
something he and i both need to forget END_TOKEN
tell me , what happened to the parshmen END_TOKEN
did they not attack the town END_TOKEN
the soldiers shifted , glancing toward roshone END_TOKEN
i said stand down , kaladin snapped END_TOKEN
you’re holding that sword like you’re going to chop a stumpweight END_TOKEN
i know amaram recruited most of the able - bodied men in the region , but i’ve seen messenger boys with more battle poise than you END_TOKEN
the soldiers looked to one another END_TOKEN
then , red - faced , the lighteyed one slid his sword back into its sheath END_TOKEN
brightlord , sir , the man said , eyes down END_TOKEN
i may not be the best soldier around , but… well , sir , trust me on this END_TOKEN
we should just pretend that punch never happened END_TOKEN
the other two soldiers nodded their heads in agreement END_TOKEN
roshone sized kaladin up , dabbing at his nose , which wasn’t bleeding badly END_TOKEN
so , they did make something out of you in the army , did they END_TOKEN
is there a room here that isn’t clogged full of people END_TOKEN
don’t give orders to brightlord roshone END_TOKEN
kaladin pushed past the soldiers and roshone , walking farther down the hallway END_TOKEN
up the stairs , sir , one of the soldiers said END_TOKEN
kaladin smiled to himself , noting the sir END_TOKEN
join me up there , men END_TOKEN
unfortunately , an authoritative bearing could only take a man so far END_TOKEN
nobody followed , not even his parents END_TOKEN
i gave you people an order , kaladin said END_TOKEN
i’m not fond of repeating myself END_TOKEN
and what , roshone said , makes you think you can order anyone around , boy END_TOKEN
kaladin turned back and swept his arm before him , summoning syl END_TOKEN
a bright , dew - covered shardblade formed from mist into his hand END_TOKEN
he spun the blade and rammed her down into the floor in one smooth motion END_TOKEN
he held the grip , feeling his eyes bleed to blue END_TOKEN
curiously , kaladin’s father just lowered his head and closed his eyes END_TOKEN
they were gone when we went back to check on them , um , brightlord , said aric , the short guard with the rusty helm END_TOKEN
we’d locked the door , but the side was ripped clean open END_TOKEN
the room was small , but neatly organized with rows of shelves and a fine reading stand END_TOKEN
each book was exactly flush with the others ; either the maids were extremely meticulous , or the books were not often moved END_TOKEN
syl perched on one shelf , her back to a book , swinging her legs girlishly over the edge END_TOKEN
roshone sat on one side of the room , periodically pushing both hands along his flushed cheeks toward the back of his head in an odd nervous gesture END_TOKEN
his nose had stopped bleeding , though he’d have a nice bruise END_TOKEN
that was a fraction of the punishment the man deserved , but kaladin found he had no passion for abusing roshone END_TOKEN
he had to be better than that END_TOKEN
what did the parshmen look like END_TOKEN
they changed , following the unusual storm END_TOKEN
i peeked when i heard them break out , after the storm passed END_TOKEN
they looked like voidbringers , i tell you , with big bony bits jutting from their skin END_TOKEN
they were taller , the guard captain added END_TOKEN
taller than me , easily as tall as you are , brightlord END_TOKEN
with legs thick as stumpweights and hands that could have strangled a whitespine , i tell you END_TOKEN
they could have easily taken the manor ; instead , they’d run off into the night END_TOKEN
it spoke of a more disturbing goal END_TOKEN
perhaps hearthstone was too small to be bothered with END_TOKEN
i don’t suppose you tracked their direction END_TOKEN
kaladin said , looking toward the guards , then roshone END_TOKEN
um , no , brightlord , the captain said END_TOKEN
honestly , we were just worried about surviving END_TOKEN
that storm ripped away four of our silos END_TOKEN
we’ll be starving afore too long , with all these refugees and no food END_TOKEN
when the highstorms start coming again , we won’t have half as many homes as we need END_TOKEN
but stormfather , the rest of the kingdom would be just as bad END_TOKEN
he needed to focus on the voidbringers END_TOKEN
he couldn’t report back to dalinar until he had the stormlight to fly home , so for now it seemed his most useful task would be to find out where the enemy was gathering , if he could END_TOKEN
kaladin hadn’t experienced their strange powers himself , though he’d heard reports of the battle of narak END_TOKEN
parshendi with glowing eyes and lightning at their command , ruthless and terrible END_TOKEN
i’ll need maps , he said END_TOKEN
maps of alethkar , as detailed as you have , and some way to carry them through the rain without ruining them END_TOKEN
several of them , the finest you have END_TOKEN
roshone asked softly , staring at the floor END_TOKEN
he pulled a handful of spheres from his pocket and dropped them on the table END_TOKEN
surely roshone keeps survey maps of the nearby areas END_TOKEN
roshone was not important enough to have stewardship over any of the highprince’s lands—a distinction kaladin had never realized while he lived in hearthstone END_TOKEN
those lands would be watched over by much more important lighteyes ; roshone would only be a first point of contact with surrounding villages END_TOKEN
we’ll want to wait for the lady’s permission , the guard captain said END_TOKEN
they’d disobey roshone for him , but not the manor’s lady END_TOKEN
go to the house ardents and tell them to prepare the things i request END_TOKEN
and locate a spanreed connected to tashikk , if any of the ardents have one END_TOKEN
once i have the stormlight to use it , i’ll want to send word to dalinar END_TOKEN
roshone , i’m going to need to chase those parshmen and see if i can figure out what they’re up to END_TOKEN
i don’t suppose any of your guards have tracking experience END_TOKEN
following the creatures would be hard enough without the rain swamping everything END_TOKEN
why do they matter so much END_TOKEN
roshone asked , still staring at the floor END_TOKEN
surely you’ve guessed , kaladin said , nodding to syl as her ribbon of light flitted over to his shoulder END_TOKEN
weather in turmoil and terrors transformed from common servants END_TOKEN
that storm with the red lightning , blowing the wrong direction END_TOKEN
the desolation is here , roshone END_TOKEN
roshone groaned , leaning forward , arms wrapped around himself as if he were going to be sick END_TOKEN
you sound apologetic , she replied , cocking her head END_TOKEN
i don’t like the idea of swinging you about , smashing you into things END_TOKEN
firstly , i don’t smash into things END_TOKEN
i am an elegant and graceful weapon , stupid END_TOKEN
secondly , why would you be bothered END_TOKEN
it doesn’t feel right , kaladin replied , still whispering END_TOKEN
you’re a woman , not a weapon END_TOKEN
wait… so this is about me being a girl END_TOKEN
no , kaladin said immediately , then hesitated END_TOKEN
you don’t ask your other weapons how they feel about being swung about END_TOKEN
she looked at him with head cocked and eyebrows raised , as if he’d said something very stupid END_TOKEN
his mother had taught him that from an early age END_TOKEN
so… some of my spears have been women , then END_TOKEN
female , at least , syl said END_TOKEN
roughly half , as these things tend to go END_TOKEN
she flitted up into the air in front of him END_TOKEN
it’s your fault for personifying us , so no complaining END_TOKEN
of course , some of the old spren have four genders instead of two END_TOKEN
she poked him in the nose END_TOKEN
because humans didn’t imagine those ones , silly END_TOKEN
she zipped out in front of him , changing into a field of mist END_TOKEN
when he raised his hand , the shardblade appeared END_TOKEN
he strode to where roshone sat , then stooped down and held the shardblade before the man , point toward the floor END_TOKEN
roshone looked up , transfixed by the weapon’s blade , as kaladin had anticipated END_TOKEN
you couldn’t be near one of these things and not be drawn by it END_TOKEN
he didn’t reply , but they both knew the truth END_TOKEN
owning a shardblade was enough—if you could claim it , and not have it taken from you , it was yours END_TOKEN
with one in his possession , the brands on his head were meaningless END_TOKEN
no man , not even roshone , would imply otherwise END_TOKEN
you , kaladin said , are a cheat , a rat , and a murderer END_TOKEN
but as much as i hate it , we don’t have time to oust alethkar’s ruling class and set up something better END_TOKEN
we are under attack by an enemy we do not understand , and which we could not have anticipated END_TOKEN
so you’re going to have to stand up and lead these people END_TOKEN
roshone stared at the blade , looking at his reflection END_TOKEN
we’re not powerless , kaladin said END_TOKEN
we can and will fight back—but first we need to survive END_TOKEN
regularly , though i don’t know the interval yet END_TOKEN
build homes with slopes in both directions END_TOKEN
if there’s not time for that , find a sheltered location and hunker down END_TOKEN
this crisis is bigger than one town , one people , even if it’s my town and my people END_TOKEN
i have to rely on you END_TOKEN
almighty preserve us , you’re all we have END_TOKEN
roshone slumped down farther in his seat END_TOKEN
we’ll do it , a voice said from behind him END_TOKEN
laral’s voice sent a shiver down his spine END_TOKEN
he turned slowly , and found a woman who did not at all match the image in his head END_TOKEN
when he’d last seen her , she’d been wearing a perfect lighteyed dress , beautiful and young , yet her pale green eyes had seemed hollow END_TOKEN
she’d lost her betrothed , roshone’s son , and had instead become engaged to the father—a man more than twice her age END_TOKEN
the woman he confronted was no longer a youth END_TOKEN
her face was firm , lean , and her hair was pulled back in a no - nonsense tail of black peppered with blonde END_TOKEN
she wore boots and a utilitarian havah , damp from the rain END_TOKEN
she looked him up and down , then sniffed END_TOKEN
looks like you went and grew up , kal END_TOKEN
i was sorry to hear the news of your brother END_TOKEN
i’ve got one to the queen regent in kholinar , but that one hasn’t been responsive lately END_TOKEN
fortunately , we do have one to tashikk , as you asked about END_TOKEN
if you think that the king will respond to you , we can go through an intermediary END_TOKEN
she walked back out the doorway END_TOKEN
i hear you stabbed my floor , she noted END_TOKEN
that’s good hardwood , i’ll have you know END_TOKEN
i dreamed of coming back , kaladin said , stopping in the hallway outside the library END_TOKEN
i imagined returning here a war hero and challenging roshone END_TOKEN
i wanted to save you , laral END_TOKEN
and what made you think i needed saving END_TOKEN
you can’t tell me , kaladin said softly , waving backward toward the library , that you’ve been happy with that END_TOKEN
becoming a lighteyes does not grant a man any measure of decorum , it appears , laral said END_TOKEN
you will stop insulting my husband , kaladin END_TOKEN
shardbearer or not , another word like that , and i’ll have you thrown from my home END_TOKEN
or i was , until the winds started blowing the wrong direction END_TOKEN
always feeling like you need to save everyone , even those who would rather you mind your own business END_TOKEN
he sent my brother to his death and did everything he could to destroy my father END_TOKEN
and your father spoke against my husband , laral said , disparaging him in front of the other townspeople END_TOKEN
how would you feel , as a new brightlord exiled far from home , only to find that the town’s most important citizen is openly critical of you END_TOKEN
her perspective was skewed , of course END_TOKEN
lirin had tried to befriend roshone at first , hadn’t he END_TOKEN
still , kaladin found little passion to continue the argument END_TOKEN
he intended to see his parents moved from this city anyway END_TOKEN
i’ll go set up the spanreed , she said END_TOKEN
it might take some time to get a reply END_TOKEN
in the meantime , the ardents should be fetching your maps END_TOKEN
great , kaladin said , pushing past her in the hallway END_TOKEN
i’m going to go speak with my parents END_TOKEN
syl zipped over his shoulder as he started down the steps END_TOKEN
so , that’s the girl you were going to marry END_TOKEN
that’s a girl i was never going to marry , no matter what happened END_TOKEN
he reached the bottom of the steps and looked back up END_TOKEN
roshone had joined laral at the top of the stairs , carrying the gems kaladin had left on the table END_TOKEN
five or six ruby broams , he thought , and maybe a sapphire or two END_TOKEN
he did the calculations in his head END_TOKEN
storms… that was a ridiculous sum— more money than the goblet full of spheres that roshone and kaladin’s father had spent years fighting over back in the day END_TOKEN
that was now mere pocket change to kaladin END_TOKEN
he’d always thought of all lighteyes as rich , but a minor brightlord in an insignificant town… well , roshone was actually poor , just a different kind of poor END_TOKEN
kaladin searched back through the house , passing people he’d once known—people who now whispered shardbearer and got out of his way with alacrity END_TOKEN
he’d accepted his place the moment he’d seized syl from the air and spoken the words END_TOKEN
lirin was back in the parlor , working on the wounded again END_TOKEN
kaladin stopped in the doorway , then sighed and knelt beside lirin END_TOKEN
as the man reached toward his tray of tools , kaladin picked it up and held it at the ready END_TOKEN
his old position as his father’s surgery assistant END_TOKEN
the new apprentice was helping with wounded in another room END_TOKEN
lirin eyed kaladin , then turned back to the patient , a young boy who had a bloodied bandage around his arm END_TOKEN
kaladin proffered them , and lirin took the tool without looking , then carefully cut the bandage free END_TOKEN
a jagged length of wood had speared the boy’s arm END_TOKEN
he whimpered as lirin palpated the flesh nearby , covered in dried blood END_TOKEN
cut out the shaft , kaladin said , and the necrotic flesh END_TOKEN
a little extreme , don’t you think END_TOKEN
might want to remove it at the elbow anyway END_TOKEN
that’s going to get infected for sure—look how dirty that wood is END_TOKEN
i don’t see any rotspren yet , and so we’re not going to take the arm off END_TOKEN
let me talk to your parents END_TOKEN
for now , chew on this END_TOKEN
he gave the boy some bark as a relaxant END_TOKEN
together , lirin and kaladin moved on ; the boy wasn’t in immediate danger , and lirin would want to operate after the anesthetic took effect END_TOKEN
you’ve hardened , lirin said to kaladin as he inspected the next patient’s foot END_TOKEN
i was worried you’d never grow calluses END_TOKEN
in truth , his calluses weren’t as deep as his father might have wanted END_TOKEN
but you’ve also become one of them , lirin said END_TOKEN
my eye color doesn’t change a thing END_TOKEN
i wasn’t speaking of your eye color , son END_TOKEN
i don’t give two chips whether a man is lighteyed or not END_TOKEN
he waved a hand , and kaladin passed him a rag to clean the toe , then started preparing a small splint END_TOKEN
what you’ve become , lirin continued , is a killer END_TOKEN
you solve problems with the fist and the sword END_TOKEN
i had hoped that you would find a place among the army’s surgeons END_TOKEN
i wasn’t given much choice , kaladin said , handing over the splint , then preparing some bandages to wrap the toe END_TOKEN
the less soul - crushing parts of it , at least END_TOKEN
i don’t suppose you’re going to stay END_TOKEN
i need to follow those parshmen END_TOKEN
and you honestly think we shouldn’t fight the voidbringers , father END_TOKEN
i know that war is inevitable END_TOKEN
i just didn’t want you to have to be a part of it END_TOKEN
i’ve seen what it does to men END_TOKEN
war flays their souls , and those are wounds i can’t heal END_TOKEN
he secured the splint , then turned to kaladin END_TOKEN
let others rend and break ; we must not harm others END_TOKEN
you’re a surgeon , father , but i’m something else END_TOKEN
words spoken to dalinar kholin in a vision END_TOKEN
i will protect those who need it END_TOKEN
today , that means hunting down some voidbringers END_TOKEN
i am… glad you returned , son END_TOKEN
kaladin rested his hand on his father’s shoulder END_TOKEN
see your mother before you leave , lirin said END_TOKEN
she has something to show you END_TOKEN
kaladin frowned , but made his way out of the healing chamber to the kitchens END_TOKEN
the entire place was lit only by candles , and not many of them END_TOKEN
everywhere he went , he saw shadows and uncertain light END_TOKEN
he filled his canteen with fresh water and found a small umbrella END_TOKEN
he’d need that for reading maps in this rain END_TOKEN
from there , he went hiking up to check on laral in the library END_TOKEN
roshone had retreated to his room , but she was sitting at a writing table with a spanreed before her END_TOKEN
well , of course , she said , frowning at him END_TOKEN
how do you have infused spheres END_TOKEN
during the clash with the voidbringers , the stormfather had summoned an irregular highstorm to match the everstorm END_TOKEN
kaladin had flown before its stormwall , fighting the assassin in white END_TOKEN
that storm was unexpected , kaladin said END_TOKEN
how in the world did you know to leave your spheres out END_TOKEN
kal , she said , it’s not so hard to hang some spheres out once a storm starts blowing END_TOKEN
the ardents have a few—i wasn’t the only one to think of it END_TOKEN
look , i’ve got someone in tashikk willing to relay a message to navani kholin , the king’s mother END_TOKEN
wasn’t that what you implied you wanted END_TOKEN
you really think she’ll respond to you END_TOKEN
the answer , blessedly , came as the spanreed started writing END_TOKEN
laral blinked , then looked up at him END_TOKEN
the last thing i did before leaving was speak with dalinar at the top of the tower END_TOKEN
hopefully that would be enough to authenticate him END_TOKEN
laral jumped , then wrote it END_TOKEN
‘kaladin , this is dalinar , ’ laral read as the message came back END_TOKEN
‘what is your status , soldier END_TOKEN
better than expected , sir , kaladin said END_TOKEN
he outlined what he’d discovered , in brief END_TOKEN
he ended by noting , i’m worried that they left because hearthstone wasn’t important enough to bother destroying END_TOKEN
i’ve ordered horses and some maps END_TOKEN
i figure i can do a little scouting and see what i can find about the enemy END_TOKEN
‘you don’t have any stormlight left END_TOKEN
i might be able to find a little END_TOKEN
i doubt it will be enough to get me home , but it will help END_TOKEN
it took a few minutes before dalinar replied , and laral took the opportunity to change the paper on the spanreed board END_TOKEN
‘your instincts are good , captain , ’ dalinar finally sent END_TOKEN
‘i feel blind in this tower END_TOKEN
get close enough to discover what the enemy is doing , but don’t take unnecessary risks END_TOKEN
send us a glyph each evening to know you are safe END_TOKEN
laral looked to him , and he nodded that the conversation was over END_TOKEN
she packed up the spanreed for him without a word , and he took it gratefully , then hurried out of the room and down the steps END_TOKEN
his activities had drawn quite a crowd of people , who had gathered in the small entry hall before the steps END_TOKEN
he intended to ask if anyone had infused spheres , but was interrupted by the sight of his mother END_TOKEN
she was speaking with several young girls , and held a toddler in her arms END_TOKEN
kaladin stopped at the foot of the steps END_TOKEN
the little boy was perhaps a year old , chewing on his hand and babbling around his fingers END_TOKEN
kaladin , meet your brother , hesina said , turning toward him END_TOKEN
some of the girls were watching him while i helped with the triage END_TOKEN
it had never occurred to him END_TOKEN
his mother would be forty - one this year , and…
his mother let him take the little boy , hold him in hands that seemed too rough to be touching such soft skin END_TOKEN
kaladin trembled , then pulled the child tight against him END_TOKEN
memories of this place had not broken him , and seeing his parents had not overwhelmed him , but this…
he could not stop the tears END_TOKEN
it wasn’t as if this changed anything—bridge four were his brothers now , as close to him as any blood relative END_TOKEN
child of peace , kaladin whispered END_TOKEN
behind him , an ardent approached with a scroll case END_TOKEN
still alive , it seemed , though she’d always seemed older than the stones themselves END_TOKEN
kaladin handed little oroden back to his mother , then wiped his eyes and took the scroll case END_TOKEN
people crowded at the edges of the room END_TOKEN
he was quite the spectacle : the surgeon’s son turned slave turned shardbearer END_TOKEN
hearthstone wouldn’t see this much excitement for another hundred years END_TOKEN
at least not if kaladin had any say about it END_TOKEN
he nodded to his father—who had stepped out of the parlor room—then turned to the crowd END_TOKEN
does anyone here have infused spheres END_TOKEN
i will trade you , two chips for one END_TOKEN
syl buzzed around him as a collection was made , and kaladin’s mother made the trades for him END_TOKEN
what he ended up with was only a pouch’s worth , but it seemed vast riches END_TOKEN
at the very least , he wasn’t going to need those horses any longer END_TOKEN
he tied the pouch closed , then looked over his shoulder as his father stepped up END_TOKEN
lirin took a small glowing diamond chip from his pocket , then handed it toward kaladin END_TOKEN
kaladin accepted it , then glanced at his mother and the little boy in her arms END_TOKEN
i want to take you to safety , he said to lirin END_TOKEN
i need to leave now , but i’ll be back soon END_TOKEN
faher , it’s the desolation , kaladin said END_TOKEN
nearby , people gasped softly , their eyes haunted END_TOKEN
storms ; kaladin should have done this in private END_TOKEN
i know of a place that is safe END_TOKEN
please don’t be stubborn , for once in your life END_TOKEN
you can take them , if they’ll go , lirin said END_TOKEN
particularly if… what you just said is true END_TOKEN
i’ll return as soon as i can END_TOKEN
kaladin set his jaw , then walked to the front door of the manor END_TOKEN
he pulled it open , letting in the sounds of rain , the scents of a drowned land END_TOKEN
he paused , looked back at the room full of dirtied townspeople , homeless and frightened END_TOKEN
they’d overheard him , but they’d known already END_TOKEN
he couldn’t leave them like this END_TOKEN
you heard correctly , kaladin said loudly to the hundred or so people gathered in the manor’s large entry hall—including roshone and laral , who stood on the steps up to the second floor END_TOKEN
kaladin sucked in some of the stormlight from his pouch END_TOKEN
pure , luminescent smoke began to rise from his skin , distinctly visible in the dim room END_TOKEN
he lashed himself upward so he rose into the air , then added a lashing downward , leaving him to hover about two feet above the floor , glowing END_TOKEN
syl formed from mist as a shardspear in his hand END_TOKEN
highprince dalinar kholin , kaladin said , stormlight puffing before his lips , has refounded the knights radiant END_TOKEN
and this time , we will not fail you END_TOKEN
the expressions in the room ranged from adoring to terrified END_TOKEN
hesina clutched her infant child in her arms , and her expression was one of pure delight , an awespren bursting around her head in a blue ring END_TOKEN
you i will protect , little one , kaladin thought at the child END_TOKEN
he nodded to his parents , then turned and lashed himself outward , streaking away into the rain - soaked night END_TOKEN
he’d stop at stringken , about half a day’s walk—or a short flight—to the south and see if he could trade spheres there END_TOKEN
that moment notwithstanding , i can honestly say this book has been brewing in me since my youth END_TOKEN
she scraped her drawing pad with agitated , bold streaks END_TOKEN
she twisted the charcoal stick in her fingers every few lines , seeking the sharpest points to make the lines a deep black END_TOKEN
mmm… pattern said from near her calves , where he adorned her skirt like embroidery END_TOKEN
she kept drawing , filling the page with black strokes END_TOKEN
i understand why you hate me , shallan END_TOKEN
i did not mean to help you kill your mother , but it is what i did END_TOKEN
shallan set her jaw and kept sketching END_TOKEN
she sat outside at urithiru , her back against a cold chunk of stone , her toes frigid , coldspren growing up like spikes around her END_TOKEN
her frazzled hair whipped past her face in a gust of air , and she had to pin the paper of her pad down with her thumbs , one trapped in her left sleeve END_TOKEN
it’s all right , shallan said in a hushed voice as the wind died down END_TOKEN
a simple landscape ; she should be able to draw a simple , calming landscape END_TOKEN
she sat on the edge of one of the ten oathgate platforms , which rose ten feet higher than the main plateau END_TOKEN
earlier in the day , she’d activated this oathgate , bringing forth a few hundred more of the thousands who were waiting at narak END_TOKEN
that would be it for a while : each use of the device used an incredible amount of stormlight END_TOKEN
even with the gemstones that the newcomers had brought , there wasn’t much to go around END_TOKEN
plus , there wasn’t much of her to go around END_TOKEN
only an active , full knight radiant could work the control buildings at the center of each platform , initiating the swap END_TOKEN
for now , that meant only shallan END_TOKEN
it meant she had to summon her blade each time END_TOKEN
the blade she’d used to kill her mother END_TOKEN
a truth she’d spoken as an ideal of her order of radiants END_TOKEN
a truth that she could no longer , therefore , stuff into the back of her mind and forget END_TOKEN
it stretched impossibly high , and she struggled to contain the enormous tower on the page END_TOKEN
jasnah had searched this place out in the hope of finding books and records here of ancient date ; so far , they hadn’t found anything like that END_TOKEN
instead , shallan struggled to understand the tower END_TOKEN
if she locked it down into a sketch , would she finally be able to grasp its incredible size END_TOKEN
she couldn’t get an angle from which to view the entire tower , so she kept fixating on the little things END_TOKEN
the balconies , the shapes of the fields , the cavernous openings—maws to engulf , consume , overwhelm END_TOKEN
she ended up with a sketch not of the tower itself , but instead a criss - crossing of lines on a field of softer charcoal END_TOKEN
she stared at the sketch , a windspren passing and troubling the pages END_TOKEN
she sighed , dropping her charcoal into her satchel and getting out a damp rag to wipe her freehand fingers END_TOKEN
down on the plateau , soldiers ran drills END_TOKEN
the thought of them all living in that place disturbed shallan END_TOKEN
but it was one she couldn’t sketch END_TOKEN
we’ll work it out , she said , eyes forward END_TOKEN
it’s not your fault my parents are dead END_TOKEN
you can hate me , pattern said END_TOKEN
she didn’t want him to understand END_TOKEN
she wanted him to convince her she was wrong END_TOKEN
i don’t hate you , pattern , shallan said END_TOKEN
the sword is me , my father , the life we led , and the way it got twisted all about END_TOKEN
i’d be shocked if you did , shallan thought END_TOKEN
fortunately , she had a distraction coming her way in the form of a scout climbing up the ramp to the platform where shallan perched END_TOKEN
the darkeyed woman wore white and blue , with trousers beneath a runner’s skirt , and had long , dark alethi hair END_TOKEN
the highprince has requested your presence END_TOKEN
bother , shallan said , while inwardly relieved to have something to do END_TOKEN
she handed the scout her sketchbook to hold while she packed up her satchel END_TOKEN
while three of the highprinces had joined dalinar on his expedition to the center of the shattered plains , the greater number had remained behind END_TOKEN
when the unexpected highstorm had come , hatham had received word via spanreed from scouts out along the plains END_TOKEN
his warcamp had been able to get out most of their spheres for recharging before the storm hit , giving him a huge amount of stormlight compared to the rest of them END_TOKEN
he was becoming a wealthy man as dalinar traded for infused spheres to work the oathgate and bring in supplies END_TOKEN
compared to that , providing spheres to her to practice her lightweaving wasn’t a terrible expense—but she still felt guilty to see that she’d drained two of them by consuming stormlight to help her with the chill air END_TOKEN
she’d have to be careful about that END_TOKEN
she got everything packed , then reached back for the sketchbook and found the scout woman flipping through the pages with wide eyes END_TOKEN
several were sketches as if looking up from the base of the tower , catching a vague sense of urithiru’s stateliness , but more giving a sense of vertigo END_TOKEN
with dissatisfaction , shallan realized she’d enhanced the surreal nature of the sketches with impossible vanishing points and perspective END_TOKEN
i’ve been trying to draw the tower , shallan said , but i can’t get it from the right angle END_TOKEN
maybe when brightlord brooding - eyes returned , he could fly her to another peak along the mountain chain END_TOKEN
i’ve never seen anything like these , the scout said , flipping pages END_TOKEN
surrealism , shallan said , taking the large sketchbook back and tucking it under her arm END_TOKEN
it was an old artistic movement END_TOKEN
i guess i defaulted to it when i couldn’t get the picture to look how i wanted END_TOKEN
hardly anyone bothers with it anymore except students END_TOKEN
it made my eyes make my brain think it forgot to wake up END_TOKEN
shallan gestured , and the scout led the way back down and across the plateau END_TOKEN
here , shallan noticed that more than a few soldiers on the field had stopped their drills and were watching her END_TOKEN
she would never again return to being just shallan , the insignificant girl from a backwater town END_TOKEN
she was now brightness radiant , ostensibly from the order of elsecallers END_TOKEN
she’d persuaded dalinar to pretend—in public , at least—that shallan was from an order that couldn’t make illusions END_TOKEN
she needed to keep that secret from spreading , or her effectiveness would be weakened END_TOKEN
the soldiers stared at her as if they expected her to grow shardplate , shoot gouts of flame from her eyes , and fly off to tear down a mountain or two END_TOKEN
probably should try to act more composed , shallan thought to herself END_TOKEN
she glanced at a soldier who wore the gold and red of hatham’s army END_TOKEN
he immediately looked down and rubbed at the glyphward prayer tied around his upper right arm END_TOKEN
dalinar was determined to recover the reputation of the radiants , but storms , you couldn’t change an entire nation’s perspective in a matter of a few months END_TOKEN
the ancient knights radiant had betrayed humankind ; while many alethi seemed willing to give the orders a fresh start , others weren’t so charitable END_TOKEN
still , she tried to keep her head high , her back straight , and to walk more like her tutors had always instructed END_TOKEN
power was an illusion of perception , as jasnah had said END_TOKEN
the first step to being in control was to see yourself as capable of being in control END_TOKEN
the scout led her into the tower and up a flight of stairs , toward dalinar’s secure section END_TOKEN
the woman asked as they walked END_TOKEN
can i ask you a question END_TOKEN
as that was a question , apparently you can END_TOKEN
what did you want to know END_TOKEN
that one was actually a statement , and that’s making me doubt my previous assertion END_TOKEN
i just… i’m curious , brightness END_TOKEN
so that was where this was going END_TOKEN
i assure you , shallan said , it is quite possible to remain properly feminine while fulfilling my duties as a knight END_TOKEN
oddly , she seemed disappointed by that response END_TOKEN
urithiru seemed to have been crafted straight from the rock of a mountain , like a sculpture END_TOKEN
indeed , there weren’t seams at the corners of rooms , nor were there distinct bricks or blocks in the walls END_TOKEN
much of the stone exposed thin lines of strata END_TOKEN
beautiful lines of varied hue , like layers of cloth stacked in a merchant’s shop END_TOKEN
the corridors often twisted about in strange curves , rarely running straight toward an intersection END_TOKEN
dalinar suggested that perhaps this was to fool invaders , like a castle fortification END_TOKEN
the sweeping turns and lack of seams made the corridors feel like tunnels END_TOKEN
shallan didn’t need a guide—the strata that cut through the walls had distinctive patterns END_TOKEN
others seemed to have trouble telling those apart , and talked of painting the floors with guidelines END_TOKEN
couldn’t they distinguish the pattern here of wide reddish strata alternating with smaller yellow ones END_TOKEN
just go in the direction where the lines were sloping slightly upward , and you’d head toward dalinar’s quarters END_TOKEN
they soon arrived , and the scout took up duty at the door in case her services were needed again END_TOKEN
shallan entered a room that only a day before had been empty , but was now arrayed with furniture , creating a large meeting place right outside dalinar and navani’s private rooms END_TOKEN
adolin , renarin , and navani sat before dalinar , who stood with hands on hips , contemplating a map of roshar on the wall END_TOKEN
though the place was stuffed with rugs and plush furniture , the finery fit this bleak chamber like a lady’s havah fit a pig END_TOKEN
i don’t know how to approach the azish , father , renarin was saying as she entered END_TOKEN
their new emperor makes them unpredictable END_TOKEN
they’re azish , adolin said , giving shallan a wave with his unwounded hand END_TOKEN
how can they not be predictable END_TOKEN
doesn’t their government mandate how to peel your fruit END_TOKEN
that’s a stereotype , renarin said END_TOKEN
he wore his bridge four uniform , but had a blanket over his shoulders and was holding a cup of steaming tea , though the room wasn’t particularly cold END_TOKEN
yes , they have a large bureaucracy END_TOKEN
a change in government is still going to cause upheaval END_TOKEN
in fact , it might be easier for this new azish emperor to change policy , since policy is well defined enough to change END_TOKEN
i wouldn’t worry about the azish , navani said , tapping her notepad with a pen , then writing something in it END_TOKEN
they’ll listen to reason ; they always do END_TOKEN
i wouldn’t be surprised if that war of theirs is enough to distract them even from the return of the desolations END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , rubbing his chin with one hand END_TOKEN
claims he’s an aspect of the almighty END_TOKEN
shallan sniffed as she slipped into the seat beside adolin , setting her satchel and drawing pad on the floor END_TOKEN
dalinar turned toward her , then clasped his hands behind his back END_TOKEN
bigger than any room he was in , brow perpetually furrowed by the deepest of thoughts END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin could make choosing what to have for breakfast look like the most important decision in all of roshar END_TOKEN
tell me , how would you deal with the makabaki kingdoms END_TOKEN
now that the storm has come as we warned , we have an opportunity to approach them from a position of strength END_TOKEN
azir is the most important , but just faced a succession crisis END_TOKEN
emul and tukar are , of course , at war , as navani noted END_TOKEN
we could certainly use tashikk’s information networks , but they’re so isolationist END_TOKEN
perhaps the weight of their involvement would persuade their neighbors END_TOKEN
yes , yes… shallan said , thoughtful END_TOKEN
i have heard of several of those places END_TOKEN
dalinar drew his lips to a line , and pattern hummed in concern on her skirts END_TOKEN
dalinar did not seem the type of man you joked with END_TOKEN
i’m sorry , brightlord , shallan continued , leaning back in her chair END_TOKEN
but i’m confused as to why you want my input END_TOKEN
i know of those kingdoms , of course—but my knowledge is an academic thing END_TOKEN
i could probably name their primary export for you , but as to foreign policy… well , i’d never even spoken to someone from alethkar before leaving my homeland END_TOKEN
i see , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
does your spren offer some counsel END_TOKEN
could you bring him out to speak to us END_TOKEN
he’s not particularly knowledgeable about our kind , which is sort of why he’s here in the first place END_TOKEN
and to be frank , brightlord , i think he’s scared of you END_TOKEN
well , he’s obviously not a fool , adolin noted END_TOKEN
dalinar shot his son a glance END_TOKEN
don’t be like that , father , adolin said END_TOKEN
if anyone would be able to go about intimidating forces of nature , it would be you END_TOKEN
dalinar sighed , turning and resting his hand on the map END_TOKEN
curiously , it was renarin who stood up , setting aside his blanket and cup , then walked over to put his hand on his father’s shoulder END_TOKEN
the youth looked even more spindly than normal when standing beside dalinar , and though his hair wasn’t as blond as adolin’s , it was still patched with yellow END_TOKEN
he seemed such a strange contrast to dalinar , cut from almost entirely different cloth END_TOKEN
it’s just so big , son , dalinar said , looking at the map END_TOKEN
how can i unite all of roshar when i’ve never even visited many of these kingdoms END_TOKEN
young shallan spoke wisdom , though she might not have recognized it END_TOKEN
now i’m expected to be responsible for them END_TOKEN
i wish i could see it all END_TOKEN
shallan shifted in her seat , feeling as if she’d been forgotten END_TOKEN
perhaps he’d sent for her because he’d wanted to seek the aid of his radiants , but the kholin dynamic had always been a family one END_TOKEN
in that , she was an intruder END_TOKEN
dalinar turned and walked to fetch a cup of wine from a warmed pitcher near the door END_TOKEN
as he passed shallan , she felt something unusual END_TOKEN
a leaping within her , as if part of her were being pulled by him END_TOKEN
he walked past again , holding a cup , and shallan slipped from her seat , following him toward the map on the wall END_TOKEN
she breathed in as she walked , drawing stormlight from her satchel in a shimmering stream END_TOKEN
it infused her , glowing from her skin END_TOKEN
she rested her freehand against the map END_TOKEN
stormlight poured off her , illuminating the map in a swirling tempest of light END_TOKEN
she didn’t exactly understand what she was doing , but she rarely did END_TOKEN
art wasn’t about understanding , but about knowing END_TOKEN
the stormlight streamed off the map , passing between her and dalinar in a rush , causing navani to scramble off her seat and back away END_TOKEN
the light swirled in the chamber and became another , larger map—floating at about table height—in the center of the room END_TOKEN
mountains grew up like furrows in a piece of cloth pressed together END_TOKEN
vast plains shone green from vines and fields of grass END_TOKEN
barren stormward hillsides grew splendid shadows of life on the leeward sides END_TOKEN
stormfather… as she watched , the topography of the landscape became real END_TOKEN
her illusions usually required a previous drawing to imitate END_TOKEN
the map stretched to the sides of the room , shimmering at the edges END_TOKEN
adolin stood up from his seat , crashing through the middle of the illusion somewhere near kharbranth END_TOKEN
wisps of stormlight broke around him , but when he moved , the image swirled and neatly re - formed behind him END_TOKEN
how… dalinar leaned down near their section , which detailed the reshi isles END_TOKEN
i can almost see the cities END_TOKEN
i don’t know if i did anything , shallan said , stepping into the illusion , feeling the stormlight swirl around her END_TOKEN
despite the detail , the perspective was still from very far away , and the mountains weren’t even as tall as one of her fingernails END_TOKEN
i couldn’t have created this , brightlord END_TOKEN
well i didn’t do it , renarin said END_TOKEN
the stormlight quite certainly came from you , brightness END_TOKEN
yes , well , your father was tugging on me at the time END_TOKEN
this is his influence—this is what he sees each time a storm blows across roshar END_TOKEN
it wasn’t me or you , but us END_TOKEN
well , shallan noted , you were complaining about not being able to take it all in END_TOKEN
how much stormlight did this take END_TOKEN
navani asked , rounding the outside of the new , vibrant map END_TOKEN
we’ll get you more , navani said with a sigh END_TOKEN
having my radiants practice with their powers is among the most valuable resources i could purchase right now END_TOKEN
even if hatham makes us pay through the nose for spheres END_TOKEN
dalinar strode through the image , disrupting it in a swirl around him END_TOKEN
he stopped near the center , beside the location of urithiru END_TOKEN
he looked from one side of the room to the other in a long , slow survey END_TOKEN
ten oathgates connecting them from long ago END_TOKEN
this is how we fight it END_TOKEN
we don’t start by saving the world—we start with this simple step END_TOKEN
we protect the cities with oathgates END_TOKEN
the voidbringers are everywhere , but we can be more mobile END_TOKEN
we can shore up capitals , deliver food or soulcasters quickly between kingdoms END_TOKEN
we can make those ten cities bastions of light and strength END_TOKEN
the enemy’s champion , dalinar said , eyes narrowing END_TOKEN
in the visions , honor told me our best chance of survival involved forcing odium to accept a contest of champions END_TOKEN
i’ve seen the enemy’s champion—a creature in black armor , with red eyes END_TOKEN
nearby , renarin had turned toward his father , eyes wide , jaw dropping END_TOKEN
azimir , capital of azir , dalinar said , stepping from urithiru to the center of azir to the west , is home to an oathgate END_TOKEN
we need to open it and gain the trust of the azish END_TOKEN
they will be important to our cause END_TOKEN
he stepped farther to the west END_TOKEN
there’s an oathgate hidden in shinovar END_TOKEN
another in the capital of babatharnam , and a fourth in far - off rall elorim , city of shadows END_TOKEN
another in rira , navani said , joining him END_TOKEN
jasnah thought it was in kurth END_TOKEN
a sixth was lost in aimia , the island that was destroyed END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , then turned toward the map’s eastern section END_TOKEN
jah keved makes seven , he said , stepping into shallan’s homeland END_TOKEN
then the shattered plains , which we hold END_TOKEN
and the last one is in kholinar , adolin said softly END_TOKEN
shallan approached and touched him on the arm END_TOKEN
spanreed communication into the city had stopped working END_TOKEN
nobody knew the status of kholinar ; their best clue had come via kaladin’s spanreed message END_TOKEN
we start small , dalinar said , with a few of the most important to holding the world END_TOKEN
we’ll contact other nations , but our focus is on these three powerhouses END_TOKEN
azir for its organization and political clout END_TOKEN
thaylenah for its shipping and naval prowess END_TOKEN
brightness davar , any insight you could offer into your homeland—and its status following the civil war—would be appreciated END_TOKEN
a knock at the door interrupted dalinar’s response END_TOKEN
he called admittance , and the scout from before peeked in END_TOKEN
brightlord , she said , looking concerned END_TOKEN
there’s something you need to see END_TOKEN
the sum of my experiences has pointed at this moment END_TOKEN
one benefit of having become brightness radiant was that for once , shallan was expected to be a part of important events END_TOKEN
nobody questioned her presence during the rush through the corridors , lit by oil lanterns carried by guards END_TOKEN
nobody thought she was out of place ; nobody even considered the propriety of leading a young woman to the scene of a brutal murder END_TOKEN
from what she overheard the scout telling dalinar , the corpse had been a lighteyed officer named vedekar perel END_TOKEN
he was from sebarial’s army , but shallan didn’t know him END_TOKEN
the body had been discovered by a scouting party in a remote part of the tower’s second level END_TOKEN
as they drew nearer , dalinar and his guards jogged the rest of the distance , outpacing shallan END_TOKEN
she tried to suck in some stormlight—but she’d used it all on that blasted map , which had disintegrated into a puff of light as they’d left END_TOKEN
that left her exhausted and annoyed END_TOKEN
ahead of her , adolin stopped and looked back END_TOKEN
he danced a moment , as if impatient , then hurried to her instead of running ahead END_TOKEN
thanks , shallan said as he fell into step beside her END_TOKEN
it’s not like he can get more dead , eh END_TOKEN
he said , then chuckled awkwardly END_TOKEN
something about this had him seriously disturbed END_TOKEN
he reached for her hand with his hurt one , which was still splinted , then winced END_TOKEN
she took his arm instead , and he held up his oil lantern as they hurried on END_TOKEN
the strata here spiraled , twisting around the floor , ceiling , and walls like the threads of a screw END_TOKEN
it was striking enough that shallan took a memory of it for later sketching END_TOKEN
shallan and adolin finally caught up to the others , passing a group of guards maintaining a perimeter END_TOKEN
though bridge four had discovered the body , they’d sent for kholin reinforcements to secure the area END_TOKEN
they protected a medium - sized chamber now lit by a multitude of oil lamps END_TOKEN
shallan paused in the doorway right before a ledge that surrounded a wide square depression , perhaps four feet deep , cut into the stone floor of the room END_TOKEN
the wall strata here continued their curving , twisting medley of oranges , reds , and browns—ballooning out across the sides of this chamber in wide bands before coiling back into narrow stripes to continue down the hall that led out the other side END_TOKEN
the dead man lay at the bottom of the cavity END_TOKEN
shallan steeled herself , but even so found the sight nauseating END_TOKEN
he lay on his back , and had been stabbed right through the eye END_TOKEN
his face was a bloody mess , his clothing disheveled from what looked to have been an extended fight END_TOKEN
dalinar and navani stood on the ledge above the pit END_TOKEN
his face was stiff , a stone END_TOKEN
she stood with her safehand raised to her lips END_TOKEN
we found him just like this , brightlord , said peet the bridgeman END_TOKEN
storm me if it doesn’t look exactly the same as what happened to highprince sadeas END_TOKEN
he’s even lying in the same position , navani said , grabbing her skirts and descending a set of steps into the lower area END_TOKEN
it made up almost the entire room END_TOKEN
shallan looked toward the upper reaches of the chamber , where several stone sculptures—like the heads of horses—extended from the walls with their mouths open END_TOKEN
navani knelt beside the body , away from the blood running toward a drain on the far side of the basin END_TOKEN
remarkable… the positioning , the puncturing of the eye… it’s exactly like what happened to sadeas END_TOKEN
this has to be the same killer END_TOKEN
nobody tried to shelter navani from the sight—as if it were completely proper for the king’s mother to be poking at a corpse END_TOKEN
maybe in alethkar , ladies were expected to do this sort of thing END_TOKEN
it was still odd to shallan how temerarious the alethi were about towing their women into battle to act as scribes , runners , and scouts END_TOKEN
she looked to adolin to get his read on the situation , and found him staring , aghast , mouth open and eyes wide END_TOKEN
he didn’t seem to hear her END_TOKEN
this is impossible , he muttered END_TOKEN
i… no , i didn’t know him , shallan END_TOKEN
but i’d assumed… i mean , i figured the death of sadeas was an isolated crime END_TOKEN
any number of people could have wanted him dead , right END_TOKEN
looks like it was something more than that , shallan said , folding her arms as dalinar walked down the steps to join navani , trailed by peet , lopen , and—remarkably—rlain of bridge four END_TOKEN
that one drew attention from the other soldiers , several of whom positioned themselves subtly to protect dalinar from the parshendi END_TOKEN
they considered him a danger , regardless of which uniform he wore END_TOKEN
dalinar said , looking toward the lighteyed captain who led the soldiers here END_TOKEN
you’re an archer , aren’t you END_TOKEN
we have you scouting the tower with bridge four END_TOKEN
the windrunners needed extra feet , sir , and access to more scouts and scribes for maps END_TOKEN
figured it was better than doing parade drills in the cold , so i volunteered my company END_TOKEN
fifth battalion… who was your policing force END_TOKEN
he… didn’t make it , sir END_TOKEN
i’m sorry , captain , dalinar said END_TOKEN
would you and your men withdraw for a moment so i can consult with my son END_TOKEN
maintain that perimeter until i tell you otherwise , but do inform king elhokar of this and send a messenger to sebarial END_TOKEN
i’ll visit and tell him about this in person , but he’d best get a warning END_TOKEN
yes , sir , the lanky archer said , calling orders END_TOKEN
the soldiers left , including the bridgemen END_TOKEN
as they moved , shallan felt something prickle at the back of her neck END_TOKEN
she shivered , and couldn’t help glancing over her shoulder , hating how this unfathomable building made her feel END_TOKEN
renarin was standing right behind her END_TOKEN
she jumped , letting out a pathetic squeak END_TOKEN
then she blushed furiously ; she’d forgotten he was even with them END_TOKEN
a few shamespren faded into view around her , floating white and red flower petals END_TOKEN
she’d rarely attracted those , which was a wonder END_TOKEN
she’d have thought they would take up permanent residence nearby END_TOKEN
didn’t mean to sneak up on you END_TOKEN
adolin walked down into the room’s basin , still looking distracted END_TOKEN
was he that upset by finding a murderer among them END_TOKEN
people tried to kill him practically every day END_TOKEN
shallan grabbed the skirt of her havah and followed him down , staying clear of the blood END_TOKEN
this is troubling , dalinar said END_TOKEN
we face a terrible threat that would wipe our kind from roshar like leaves before the stormwall END_TOKEN
i don’t have time to worry about a murderer slinking through these tunnels END_TOKEN
most of the men i’d have assigned to an investigation like this are dead END_TOKEN
niter , malan… the king’s guard is no better , and the bridgemen—for all their fine qualities—have no experience with this sort of thing END_TOKEN
i’ll need to leave it to you , son END_TOKEN
you did well investigating the incident with the king’s saddle , even if that turned out to be something of a wind chase END_TOKEN
go to him , explain what happened , and set one of his policing teams to investigate END_TOKEN
then work with them as my liaison END_TOKEN
you want me , adolin said , to investigate who killed sadeas END_TOKEN
dalinar nodded , squatting down beside the corpse , though shallan had no idea what he expected to see END_TOKEN
perhaps if i put my son on the job , it will convince people i’m serious about finding the killer END_TOKEN
perhaps not—they might just think i’ve put someone in charge who can keep the secret END_TOKEN
she would have known how to spin this , to keep opinion from turning against us in court END_TOKEN
either way , son , stay on this END_TOKEN
make sure the remaining highprinces at least know that we consider these murders a priority , and that we are dedicated to finding the one who committed them END_TOKEN
she glanced toward renarin , who still stood up above , on the walkway around the empty pool END_TOKEN
he watched adolin with unblinking sapphire eyes END_TOKEN
he was always a little strange , but he seemed to know something she didn’t END_TOKEN
on her skirt , pattern hummed softly END_TOKEN
dalinar and navani eventually left to speak with sebarial END_TOKEN
once they were gone , shallan seized adolin by the arm END_TOKEN
you knew that dead man , didn’t you END_TOKEN
do you know who killed him END_TOKEN
he looked her in the eyes END_TOKEN
i have no idea who did this , shallan END_TOKEN
but i am going to find out END_TOKEN
she held his light blue eyes , weighing his gaze END_TOKEN
storms , what was she thinking END_TOKEN
adolin was a wonderful man , but he was about as deceitful as a newborn END_TOKEN
he stalked off , and shallan hurried after him END_TOKEN
renarin remained in the room , looking down the hall after them until shallan got far enough away that—over her shoulder—she could no longer see him END_TOKEN
perhaps my heresy stretches back to those days in my childhood , where these ideas began END_TOKEN
kaladin leaped from a hilltop , preserving stormlight by lashing himself upward just enough to give him some lift END_TOKEN
he soared through the rain , angled toward another hilltop END_TOKEN
beneath him , the valley was clogged with vivim trees , which wound their spindly branches together to create an almost impenetrable wall of forestation END_TOKEN
he landed lightly , skidding across the wet stone past rainspren like blue candles END_TOKEN
he dismissed his lashing , and as the force of the ground reasserted itself , he stepped into a quick march END_TOKEN
he’d learned to march before learning the spear or shield END_TOKEN
he could almost hear hav’s voice barking commands from the back of the line , where he helped stragglers END_TOKEN
hav had always said that once men could march together , learning to fight was easy END_TOKEN
she’d taken the shape of a large raindrop streaking through the air beside him , falling the wrong way END_TOKEN
it was a natural shape , but also completely wrong END_TOKEN
you’re right , kaladin said , rain dribbling down his face END_TOKEN
storms , how odd it sounded to say that END_TOKEN
i didn’t intend it as a reprimand END_TOKEN
hard to tell with you sometimes END_TOKEN
and what was that supposed to mean END_TOKEN
two days ago , i found that my mother is still alive , kaladin said , so the position is not , in fact , vacant END_TOKEN
you can stop trying to fill it END_TOKEN
he lashed himself upward slightly , then let himself slide down the wet stone of the steep hill , standing sideways END_TOKEN
he passed open rockbuds and wiggling vines , glutted and fat from the constant rainfall END_TOKEN
following the weeping , they’d often find as many dead plants around the town as they did after a strong highstorm END_TOKEN
well , i’m not trying to mother you , syl said , still a raindrop END_TOKEN
talking to her could be a surreal experience END_TOKEN
though perhaps i chide you on occasion , when you’re being sullen END_TOKEN
she transformed into the shape of a young woman in a havah , seated in the air and holding an umbrella as she moved along beside him END_TOKEN
it is my solemn and important duty to bring happiness , light , and joy into your world when you’re being a dour idiot END_TOKEN
which is most of the time END_TOKEN
kaladin chuckled , holding a little stormlight as he ran up the side of the next hill , then skidded down into the next valley END_TOKEN
this was prime farmland ; there was a reason why the akanny region was prized by sadeas END_TOKEN
it might be a cultural backwater , but these rolling fields probably fed half the kingdom with their lavis and tallew crops END_TOKEN
other villages focused on raising large passels of hogs for leather and meat END_TOKEN
gumfrems , a kind of chull - like beast , were less common pasture animals harvested for their gemhearts , which—though small—allowed soulcasting of meat END_TOKEN
syl turned into a ribbon of light and zipped in front of him , making loops END_TOKEN
it was difficult not to feel uplifted , even in the gloomy weather END_TOKEN
he’d spent the entire sprint to alethkar worrying—and then assuming—that he’d be too late to save hearthstone END_TOKEN
to find his parents alive… well , it was an unexpected blessing END_TOKEN
the type his life had been severely lacking END_TOKEN
so he gave in to the urging of the stormlight END_TOKEN
though he’d spent two days chasing the voidbringers , kaladin’s exhaustion had faded END_TOKEN
there weren’t many empty beds to be found in the broken villages he passed , but he had been able to find a roof to keep him dry and something warm to eat END_TOKEN
he’d started at hearthstone and worked his way outward in a spiral— visiting villages , asking after the local parshmen , then warning people that the terrible storm would return END_TOKEN
so far , he hadn’t found a single town or village that had been attacked END_TOKEN
kaladin reached the next hilltop and pulled to a stop END_TOKEN
a weathered stone post marked a crossroads END_TOKEN
during his youth , he’d never gotten this far from hearthstone , though he wasn’t more than a few days’ walk away END_TOKEN
syl zipped up to him as he shaded his eyes from the rain END_TOKEN
the glyphs and simple map on the stone marker would indicate the distance to the next town—but he didn’t need that END_TOKEN
he could make it out as a smudge in the gloom END_TOKEN
a fairly large town , by local standards END_TOKEN
come on , he said , starting down the hillside END_TOKEN
i think , syl said , landing on his shoulder and becoming a young woman , i would make a wonderful mother END_TOKEN
you’re the one who brought it up END_TOKEN
in comparing syl to his mother for nagging him END_TOKEN
are you even capable of having children END_TOKEN
i have no idea , syl proclaimed END_TOKEN
you call the stormfather… well , father END_TOKEN
helped shape me , is more like it END_TOKEN
so maybe you could do that , kaladin said END_TOKEN
find little , uh , bits of the wind END_TOKEN
he used a lashing to leap over a snarl of rockbuds and vines , and startled a pack of cremlings as he landed , sending them scuttling away from a nearly clean mink skeleton END_TOKEN
probably the leavings of a larger predator END_TOKEN
i would be an excellent mother END_TOKEN
i’d teach the little spren to fly , to coast the winds , to harass you END_TOKEN
you’d get distracted by an interesting beetle and fly off , leaving them in a drawer somewhere END_TOKEN
why would i leave my babies in a drawer END_TOKEN
he flew the remaining distance to the village , and the sight of broken buildings at the western edge dampened his mood END_TOKEN
though the destruction continued to be less than he’d feared , every town or village had lost people to the winds or the terrible lightning END_TOKEN
this village—hornhollow , the map called it—was in what once would have been considered an ideal location END_TOKEN
the land here dipped into a depression , and a hill to the east cut the brunt of the highstorms END_TOKEN
it held about two dozen structures , including two large storm sanctuaries where travelers could stay—but there were also many outer buildings END_TOKEN
this was the highprince’s land , and an industrious darkeyes of high enough nahn could get a commission to work an unused hill out by itself , then keep a portion of the crop END_TOKEN
a few sphere lanterns gave light to the square , where people had gathered for a town meeting END_TOKEN
kaladin dropped toward the lights and held his hand to the side END_TOKEN
syl formed there by unspoken command , taking the shape of a shardblade : a sleek , beautiful sword with the symbol of the windrunners prominent on the center , with lines sweeping off it toward the hilt—grooves in the metal that looked like flowing tresses of hair END_TOKEN
though kaladin preferred a spear , the blade was a symbol END_TOKEN
kaladin hit the ground in the center of the village , near its large central cistern , used to catch rainwater and filter away the crem END_TOKEN
he rested the sylblade on his shoulder and stretched out his other hand , preparing his speech END_TOKEN
i am kaladin , of the knights radiant END_TOKEN
a portly lighteyed man stumbled out of the crowd , wearing a long raincloak and a wide - brimmed hat END_TOKEN
he looked ridiculous , but it was the weeping END_TOKEN
constant rain didn’t exactly encourage heights of fashion END_TOKEN
the man clapped his hands in an energetic motion , and a pair of ardents stumbled up beside him , bearing goblets full of glowing spheres END_TOKEN
around the perimeter of the square , people hissed and whispered , anticipationspren flapping in an unseen wind END_TOKEN
several men held up small children to get a better look END_TOKEN
in his mind , he heard syl giggle END_TOKEN
well , best to put on a good show of it END_TOKEN
he lifted the sylblade high overhead , prompting a cheer from the crowd END_TOKEN
he would have bet that most of the people in this square used to curse the name of the radiants , but none of that was manifest now in the people’s enthusiasm END_TOKEN
it was hard to believe that centuries of mistrust and vilification would be forgotten so quickly END_TOKEN
but with the sky breaking and the land in turmoil , people would look to a symbol END_TOKEN
he knew all too well the danger of symbols END_TOKEN
amaram had been one to him , long ago END_TOKEN
you knew of my coming , kaladin said to the citylord and the ardents END_TOKEN
you’ve been in contact with your neighbors END_TOKEN
have they told you what i’ve been saying END_TOKEN
yes , brightlord , the lighteyed man said , gesturing eagerly for him to take the spheres END_TOKEN
as he did so—replacing them with spent ones he’d traded for previously—the man’s expression fell noticeably END_TOKEN
expected me to pay two for one as i did at the first few towns , did you END_TOKEN
well , he dropped a few extra dun spheres in END_TOKEN
he’d rather be known as generous , particularly if it helped word spread , but he couldn’t halve his spheres each time he went through them END_TOKEN
this is good , kaladin said , fishing out a few small gemstones END_TOKEN
i can’t visit every holding in the area END_TOKEN
i need you to send messages to each nearby village , carrying words of comfort and command from the king END_TOKEN
i will pay for the time of your runners END_TOKEN
he looked out at the sea of eager faces , and couldn’t help but remember a similar day in hearthstone where he and the rest of the townspeople had waited , eager to catch a glimpse of their new citylord END_TOKEN
of course , brightlord , the lighteyed man said END_TOKEN
would you wish to rest now , and take a meal END_TOKEN
or would you rather visit the location of the attack immediately END_TOKEN
kaladin said , feeling a spike of alarm END_TOKEN
yes , brightlord , the portly lighteyes said END_TOKEN
to see where the rogue parshmen assaulted us END_TOKEN
they’d attacked a grain storage just outside town END_TOKEN
squashed between two hills and shaped like a dome , it had weathered the everstorm without so much as a loosed stone END_TOKEN
that made it a particular shame that the voidbringers had ripped open the door and pillaged what was inside END_TOKEN
kaladin knelt within , flipping over a broken hinge END_TOKEN
the building smelled of dust and tallew , but was too wet END_TOKEN
townspeople who would suffer a dozen leaks in their bedroom would go to great expense to keep their grain dry END_TOKEN
it felt odd to not have the rain on his head , though he could still hear it pattering outside END_TOKEN
she was young , pretty , and nervous END_TOKEN
obviously she didn’t know where he fit into the scheme of her religion END_TOKEN
the knights radiant had been founded by the heralds , but they were also traitors END_TOKEN
so… he was either a divine being of myth or a cretin one step above a voidbringer END_TOKEN
yes , please , kaladin said END_TOKEN
of the five eyewitnesses , the ardent said , four , um , independently counted the number of attackers at… fifty or so END_TOKEN
anyway , it’s safe to say that they’ve got large numbers , considering how many sacks of grain they were able to carry away in such a short time END_TOKEN
they , um , didn’t look exactly like parshmen END_TOKEN
too tall , and wearing armor END_TOKEN
she tried showing him her sketch again END_TOKEN
it wasn’t much better than a child’s drawing : a bunch of scribbles in vaguely humanoid shapes END_TOKEN
anyway , the young ardent continued , oblivious to the fact that syl had landed on her shoulder and was inspecting her face END_TOKEN
they attacked right after first moonset END_TOKEN
they had the grain out by middle of second moon , um , and we didn’t hear anything until the change of guard happened END_TOKEN
sot raised the alarm , and that chased the creatures off they only left four sacks , which we moved END_TOKEN
kaladin took a crude wooden cudgel off the table next to the ardent END_TOKEN
the ardent glanced at him , then quickly looked back to her paper , blushing END_TOKEN
the room , lit by oil lamps , was depressingly hollow END_TOKEN
this grain should have gotten the village to the next harvest END_TOKEN
to a man from a farming village , nothing was more distressing than an empty silo at planting time END_TOKEN
kaladin said , inspecting the cudgel , which the voidbringers had dropped while fleeing END_TOKEN
they’ve both recovered , brightlord , the ardent said END_TOKEN
though khem has a ringing in his ear he says won’t go away END_TOKEN
fifty parshmen in warform—which was what the descriptions sounded most like to him—could easily have overrun this town and its handful of militia guards END_TOKEN
they could have slaughtered everyone and taken whatever they wished ; instead , they’d made a surgical raid END_TOKEN
the red lights , kaladin said END_TOKEN
the ardent started ; she’d been looking at him END_TOKEN
um , all five witnesses mentioned the lights , brightlord END_TOKEN
there were several small glowing red lights in the darkness END_TOKEN
if those were eyes , it was only a few END_TOKEN
i went and asked , and none of the witnesses specifically saw eyes glowing—and khem got a look right in one of the parshmen’s faces as they struck him END_TOKEN
kaladin dropped the cudgel and dusted off his palms END_TOKEN
he took the sheet with the picture on it out of the young ardent’s hands and inspected it , just for show , then nodded to her END_TOKEN
syl said , still on the ardent’s shoulder END_TOKEN
kaladin drew his lips to a line END_TOKEN
he nodded to the woman and left her , striking back into the rain toward the center of town END_TOKEN
syl zipped up to his shoulder END_TOKEN
she must be desperate living out here END_TOKEN
i mean , look at you END_TOKEN
hair that hasn’t been combed since you flew across the continent , uniform stained with crem , and that beard END_TOKEN
thank you for the boost of confidence END_TOKEN
i guess when there’s nobody about but farmers , your standards really drop END_TOKEN
she’s an ardent , kaladin said END_TOKEN
she’d have to marry another ardent END_TOKEN
i don’t think she was thinking about marriage , kaladin… syl said , turning and looking backward over her shoulder END_TOKEN
i know you’ve been busy lately fighting guys in white clothing and stuff , but i’ve been doing research END_TOKEN
people lock their doors , but there’s plenty of room to get in underneath END_TOKEN
i figured , since you don’t seem inclined to do any learning yourself , i should study END_TOKEN
i’m well aware of what is involved END_TOKEN
maybe we could have that ardent draw you a picture END_TOKEN
she seems like she’d be really eager END_TOKEN
i just want you to be happy , kaladin , she said , zipping off his shoulder and running a few rings around him as a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
that , kaladin said , is demonstrably false END_TOKEN
i know a lot who aren’t END_TOKEN
the words struck uncomfortably close to the truth END_TOKEN
shallan is engaged to dalinar’s son END_TOKEN
i don’t trust him one bit END_TOKEN
you don’t trust anyone who carries a shardblade , syl , kaladin said with a sigh END_TOKEN
it’s not a mark of bad character to have bonded one of the weapons END_TOKEN
yes , well , let’s have someone swing around the corpse of your sisters by the feet , and we’ll see whether you consider it a ‘mark of bad character’ or not END_TOKEN
like that lightweaver could be for you…
shallan’s a lighteyes , kaladin said END_TOKEN
that’s the end of the conversation END_TOKEN
end , he said , stepping into the home of the village lighteyes END_TOKEN
then he added under his breath , and stop spying on people when they’re being intimate END_TOKEN
the way she spoke , she expected to be there when kaladin… well , he’d never considered that before , though she went with him everywhere else END_TOKEN
could he convince her to wait outside END_TOKEN
she’d still listen , if not sneak in to watch END_TOKEN
his life just kept getting stranger END_TOKEN
he tried— unsuccessfully—to banish the image of lying in bed with a woman , syl sitting on the headboard and shouting out encouragement and advice END_TOKEN
the citylord asked from inside the front room of the small home END_TOKEN
your scouts are certain of the direction the parshmen went END_TOKEN
the citylord looked over his shoulder at a scraggly man in leathers , bow on his back , standing by the boarded - up window END_TOKEN
trapper , with a writ from the local highlord to catch mink on his lands END_TOKEN
followed them half a day out , brightlord END_TOKEN
straight toward kholinar , i’d swear to kelek himself END_TOKEN
then that’s where i’m going as well , kaladin said END_TOKEN
you want me to lead you , brightlord radiant END_TOKEN
afraid you’d just slow me down END_TOKEN
he nodded to the men , then stepped out and lashed himself upward END_TOKEN
people clogged the road and cheered from rooftops as he left the town behind END_TOKEN
the scents of horses reminded adolin of his youth END_TOKEN
sweat , and manure , and hay END_TOKEN
he’d spent many of those days , before he was fully a man , on campaign with his father during border skirmishes with jah keved END_TOKEN
adolin had been afraid of horses back then , though he’d never have admitted it END_TOKEN
so much faster , more intelligent , than chulls END_TOKEN
creatures all covered in hair—which made him shiver to touch—with big glassy eyes END_TOKEN
and those hadn’t even been real horses END_TOKEN
for all their pedigree breeding , the horses they’d rode on campaign had just been ordinary shin thoroughbreds END_TOKEN
but by definition , therefore , not priceless END_TOKEN
not like the creature before him now END_TOKEN
they were housing the kholin livestock in the far northwest section of the tower , on the ground floor , near where winds from outside blew along the mountains END_TOKEN
some clever constructions in the hallways by the royal engineers had ventilated the scents away from the inner corridors , though that left the region quite chilly END_TOKEN
gumfrems and hogs clogged some rooms , while conventional horses stabled in others END_TOKEN
several even contained bashin’s axehounds , animals who never got to go on hunts anymore END_TOKEN
such accommodations weren’t good enough for the blackthorn’s horse END_TOKEN
no , the massive black ryshadium stallion had been given his own field END_TOKEN
large enough to serve as a pasture , it was open to the sky and in an enviable spot , if you discounted the scents of the other animals END_TOKEN
as adolin emerged from the tower , the black monster of a horse came galloping over END_TOKEN
big enough to carry a shardbearer without looking small , ryshadium were often called the third shard END_TOKEN
blade , plate , and mount END_TOKEN
you couldn’t earn a ryshadium simply by defeating someone in combat END_TOKEN
but , adolin thought as gallant nuzzled his hand , i suppose that was how it used to be with blades too END_TOKEN
they were spren who chose their bearers END_TOKEN
hey , adolin said , scratching the ryshadium’s snout with his left hand END_TOKEN
a little lonely out here , isn’t it END_TOKEN
wish you weren’t alone any— he cut off as his voice caught in his throat END_TOKEN
gallant stepped closer , towering over him , but somehow still gentle END_TOKEN
the horse nuzzled adolin’s neck , then blew out sharply END_TOKEN
ugh , adolin said , turning the horse’s head END_TOKEN
that’s a scent i could do without END_TOKEN
he patted gallant’s neck , then reached with his right hand into his shoulder pack—before a sharp pain from his wrist reminded him yet again of his wound END_TOKEN
he reached in with the other hand and took out some sugar lumps , which gallant consumed eagerly END_TOKEN
you’re as bad as aunt navani , adolin noted END_TOKEN
that’s why you came running , isn’t it END_TOKEN
the horse turned his head , looking at adolin with one watery blue eye , rectangular pupil at the center END_TOKEN
adolin often had felt he could read his own ryshadium’s emotions END_TOKEN
there had been a… bond between him and sureblood END_TOKEN
more delicate and indefinable than the bond between man and sword , but still there END_TOKEN
of course , adolin was the one who talked to his sword sometimes , so he had a habit of this sort of thing END_TOKEN
i know the two of you liked to run together END_TOKEN
and… i don’t know if father will be able to get down as much to see you END_TOKEN
he’d already been withdrawing from battle before he got all these new responsibilities END_TOKEN
i thought i’d stop by once in a while END_TOKEN
not to ride you , adolin said , reading indignation in the ryshadium’s motions END_TOKEN
i just thought it might be nice for both of us END_TOKEN
the horse poked his snout at adolin’s satchel until he dug out another sugar cube END_TOKEN
it seemed like agreement to adolin , who fed the horse , then leaned back against the wall and watched him gallop through the pasture END_TOKEN
showing off adolin thought with amusement as gallant pranced past him END_TOKEN
maybe gallant would let him brush his coat END_TOKEN
that would feel good , like the evenings he’d spent with sureblood in the dark calm of the stables END_TOKEN
at least , that was what he’d done before everything had gotten busy , with shallan and the duels and everything else END_TOKEN
he’d ignored the horse right up until he’d needed sureblood in battle END_TOKEN
and then , in a flash of light , he was gone END_TOKEN
not just sureblood , but what he’d done to sadeas , and now the investigation…
watching gallant seemed to help a little END_TOKEN
adolin was still there , leaning against the wall , when renarin arrived END_TOKEN
the younger kholin poked his head through the doorway , looking around END_TOKEN
he didn’t shy away when gallant galloped past , but he did regard the stallion with wariness END_TOKEN
hey , adolin said from the side END_TOKEN
bashin said you were down here END_TOKEN
just checking on gallant , adolin said END_TOKEN
because father’s been so busy lately END_TOKEN
you could ask shallan to draw sureblood , renarin said END_TOKEN
i bet , um , she’d be able to do a good job END_TOKEN
it wasn’t a bad suggestion , actually END_TOKEN
were you looking for me , then END_TOKEN
i… renarin watched gallant as the horse pranced by again END_TOKEN
they don’t fit , you know END_TOKEN
ryshadium have stone hooves , renarin said , stronger than ordinary horses’ END_TOKEN
and that makes them not fit END_TOKEN
i’d say that makes them fit better END_TOKEN
you mean ordinary horses , don’t you END_TOKEN
people had trouble following him sometimes , but that was merely because he tended to be so thoughtful END_TOKEN
he’d be thinking about something deep , something brilliant , and then would only mention a part END_TOKEN
it made him seem erratic , but once you got to know him , you realized he wasn’t trying to be esoteric END_TOKEN
his lips just sometimes failed to keep up with his brain END_TOKEN
i… um… i have to give you back the shardblade you won for me END_TOKEN
it hurts to hold , renarin said END_TOKEN
it always has , to be honest END_TOKEN
i thought it was just me , being strange END_TOKEN
we can’t use the dead blades END_TOKEN
well , i suppose i could find someone else to use it , adolin said , running through options END_TOKEN
though you should really be the one to choose END_TOKEN
by right of bestowal , the blade is yours , and you should pick the successor END_TOKEN
i’ve given it to the ardents already , for safekeeping END_TOKEN
which means you’ll be unarmed , adolin said END_TOKEN
or not , adolin said , then poked renarin in the shoulder END_TOKEN
you’ve got a replacement already , don’t you END_TOKEN
you’ve managed to create a radiant blade END_TOKEN
glys wasn’t certain he could do it… but we need more people to work the oathgate… so…
he took a deep breath , then stretched his hand to the side and summoned a long glowing shardblade END_TOKEN
thin , with almost no crossguard , it had waving folds to the metal , like it had been forged END_TOKEN
adolin gave him a flat stare END_TOKEN
i simply… adolin , i was starting to fit in END_TOKEN
with bridge four , with being a shardbearer END_TOKEN
now , i’m in the darkness again END_TOKEN
father expects me to be a radiant , so i can help him unite the world END_TOKEN
but how am i supposed to learn END_TOKEN
adolin scratched his chin with his good hand END_TOKEN
i assumed that it just kind of came to you END_TOKEN
but it… frightens me , adolin END_TOKEN
he held up his hand , and it started to glow , wisps of stormlight trailing off it , like smoke from a fire END_TOKEN
what if i hurt someone , or ruin things END_TOKEN
you’re not going to , adolin said END_TOKEN
renarin , that’s the power of the almighty himself END_TOKEN
renarin only stared at that glowing hand , and didn’t seem convinced END_TOKEN
so adolin reached out with his good hand and took renarin’s , holding it END_TOKEN
this is good , adolin said to him END_TOKEN
you’re not going to hurt anyone END_TOKEN
renarin looked to him , then smiled END_TOKEN
a pulse of radiance washed through adolin , and for an instant he saw himself perfected END_TOKEN
a version of himself that was somehow complete and whole , the man he could be END_TOKEN
it was gone in a moment , and renarin pulled his hand free and murmured an apology END_TOKEN
he mentioned again the shardblade needing to be given away , then fled back into the tower END_TOKEN
gallant trotted up and nudged him for more sugar , so he reached absently into his satchel and fed the horse END_TOKEN
only after gallant trotted off did adolin realize he’d used his right hand END_TOKEN
he held it up , amazed , moving his fingers END_TOKEN
his wrist had been completely healed END_TOKEN
dalinar danced from one foot to the other in the morning mist , feeling a new power , an energy in every step END_TOKEN
the world would never be the same place END_TOKEN
they’d all expected he would someday have his own plate or blade , but he’d never been able to quiet the whisper of uncertainty from the back of his mind END_TOKEN
he’d won it himself , in combat END_TOKEN
yes , that combat had involved kicking a man off a cliff , but he’d defeated a shardbearer regardless END_TOKEN
he couldn’t help but bask in how grand it felt END_TOKEN
calm , dalinar , sadeas said from beside him in the mist END_TOKEN
sadeas wore his own golden plate END_TOKEN
it won’t do any good , sadeas , gavilar—clad in bright blue plate— said from dalinar’s other side END_TOKEN
all three of them wore their faceplates up for the moment END_TOKEN
the kholin boys are chained axehounds , and we smell blood END_TOKEN
we can’t go into battle breathing calming breaths , centered and serene , as the ardents teach END_TOKEN
dalinar shifted , feeling the cold morning fog on his face END_TOKEN
he wanted to dance with the anticipationspren whipping in the air around him END_TOKEN
behind , the army waited in disciplined ranks , their footsteps , clinkings , coughs , and murmured banter rising through the fog END_TOKEN
he almost felt as if he didn’t need that army END_TOKEN
he wore a massive hammer on his back , so heavy an unaided man—even the strongest of them— wouldn’t be able to lift it END_TOKEN
it felt remarkably like the thrill END_TOKEN
have you given thought to my suggestion , dalinar END_TOKEN
if gavilar commands me , dalinar said , i’ll marry END_TOKEN
don’t bring me into this , gavilar said END_TOKEN
he summoned and dismissed his shardblade repeatedly as they talked END_TOKEN
well , dalinar said , until you say something , i’m staying single END_TOKEN
the only woman he’d ever wanted belonged to gavilar END_TOKEN
they’d married—storms , they had a child now END_TOKEN
his brother must never know how dalinar felt END_TOKEN
but think of the benefit , dalinar , sadeas said END_TOKEN
your wedding could bring us alliances , shards END_TOKEN
perhaps you could win us a princedom—one we wouldn’t have to storming drive to the brink of collapse before they join us END_TOKEN
after two years of fighting , only four of the ten princedoms had accepted gavilar’s rule—and two of those , kholin and sadeas , had been easy END_TOKEN
the result was a united alethkar : against house kholin END_TOKEN
gavilar was convinced that he could play them off one another , that their natural selfishness would lead them to stab one another in the back END_TOKEN
sadeas , in turn , pushed gavilar toward greater brutality END_TOKEN
he claimed that the fiercer their reputation , the more cities would turn to them willingly rather than risk being pillaged END_TOKEN
will you at least consider a union of political necessity END_TOKEN
storms , you still on that END_TOKEN
you and my brother can worry about politics END_TOKEN
you can’t escape this forever , dalinar END_TOKEN
we’ll have to worry about feeding the darkeyes , about city infrastructure , about ties with other kingdoms END_TOKEN
you and gavilar , dalinar said END_TOKEN
all of us , sadeas said END_TOKEN
weren’t you trying to get me to relax END_TOKEN
the rising sun finally started to disperse the fog , and that let him see their target : a wall about twelve feet high END_TOKEN
a flat rocky expanse , or so it appeared END_TOKEN
the chasm city was difficult to spot from this direction END_TOKEN
named rathalas , it was also known as the rift : an entire city that had been built inside a rip in the ground END_TOKEN
brightlord tanalan is a shardbearer , right END_TOKEN
sadeas sighed , lowering his faceplate END_TOKEN
we only went over this four times , dalinar END_TOKEN
blade only , brother , gavilar said END_TOKEN
only if you find him first END_TOKEN
i’ve half a mind to give that blade to sadeas END_TOKEN
at least he listens in our meetings END_TOKEN
gavilar gave dalinar a grin , slammed his faceplate down , then took off running to leave sadeas midsentence END_TOKEN
dalinar whooped and joined him , plated boots grinding against stone END_TOKEN
sadeas cursed loudly , then followed END_TOKEN
the army remained behind for the moment END_TOKEN
rocks started falling ; catapults from behind the wall hurled solitary boulders or sprays of smaller rocks END_TOKEN
chunks slammed down around dalinar , shaking the ground , causing rockbud vines to curl up END_TOKEN
a boulder struck just ahead , then bounced , spraying chips of stone END_TOKEN
dalinar skidded past it , the plate lending a spring to his motion END_TOKEN
he raised his arm before his eye slit as a hail of arrows darkened the sky END_TOKEN
atop the wall , soldiers aimed massive crossbowlike devices mounted to the stone END_TOKEN
one sleek bolt—the size of a spear—launched directly at dalinar , and it proved far more accurate than the catapults END_TOKEN
he threw himself to the side , plate grinding on stone as he slid out of the way END_TOKEN
the bolt hit the ground with such force that the wood shattered END_TOKEN
other shafts trailed netting and ropes , hoping to trip a shardbearer and render him prone for a second shot END_TOKEN
dalinar grinned , feeling the thrill awaken within him , and recovered his feet END_TOKEN
he leaped over a bolt trailing netting END_TOKEN
tanalan’s men delivered a storm of wood and stone , but it wasn’t nearly enough END_TOKEN
dalinar took a stone in the shoulder and lurched , but quickly regained his momentum END_TOKEN
arrows were useless against him , the boulders too random , and the ballistas too slow to reload END_TOKEN
this was how it should be END_TOKEN
a good battle in the day—then at night , a warm hearth , tired muscles , and a good vintage of wine END_TOKEN
dalinar reached the squat wall and leaped , propelling himself in a mighty jump END_TOKEN
he gained just enough height to grab one of the crenels of the wall’s top END_TOKEN
men raised hammers to pound his fingers , but he hurled himself over the lip and onto the wall walk , crashing down amid panicked defenders END_TOKEN
he jerked the release rope on his hammer—dropping it on an enemy behind—then swung out with his fist , sending men broken and screaming END_TOKEN
he seized his hammer , then brought it up and swung it in a wide arc , tossing men from the wall like leaves before a gust of wind END_TOKEN
just beyond him , sadeas kicked over a ballista , destroying the device with a casual blow END_TOKEN
gavilar attacked with his blade , dropping corpses by the handful , their eyes burning END_TOKEN
up here , the fortification worked against the defenders , leaving them cramped and clumped up—perfect for shardbearers to destroy END_TOKEN
dalinar surged through them , and in a few moments likely killed more men than he had in his entire life END_TOKEN
at that , he felt a surprising yet profound dissatisfaction END_TOKEN
this was not about his skill , his momentum , or even his reputation END_TOKEN
you could have replaced him with a toothless gaffer and produced practically the same result END_TOKEN
he gritted his teeth against that sudden useless emotion END_TOKEN
he dug deeply within , and found the thrill waiting END_TOKEN
it filled him , driving away dissatisfaction END_TOKEN
within moments he was roaring his pleasure END_TOKEN
nothing these men did could touch him END_TOKEN
he was a destroyer , a conqueror , a glorious maelstrom of death END_TOKEN
the silly man gestured in his golden shardplate END_TOKEN
dalinar blinked , looking out over the wall END_TOKEN
he could see the rift proper from this vantage , a deep chasm in the ground that hid an entire city , built up the sides of either cliff
gavilar’s armies had started to charge the walls END_TOKEN
those catapults—near the way down into the rift proper—were still launching stones , and would drop hundreds of men END_TOKEN
dalinar leaped for the edge of the wall and grabbed a rope ladder to swing down END_TOKEN
the ropes , of course , immediately snapped , sending him toppling to the ground END_TOKEN
he struck with a crash of plate on stone END_TOKEN
it didn’t hurt , but his pride took a serious blow END_TOKEN
above , sadeas looked at him over the edge END_TOKEN
dalinar could practically hear his voice END_TOKEN
take some time to think once in a while , won’t you END_TOKEN
that had been a flat - out greenvine mistake END_TOKEN
dalinar growled and climbed to his feet , searching for his hammer END_TOKEN
he’d bent the handle in his fall END_TOKEN
it wasn’t made of the same strange metal as blades and plate , but it was still good steel END_TOKEN
soldiers guarding the catapults swarmed toward him while the shadows of boulders passed overhead END_TOKEN
dalinar set his jaw , the thrill saturating him , and reached for a stout wooden door set into the wall nearby END_TOKEN
he ripped it free , the hinges popping , and stumbled END_TOKEN
it came off more easily than he’d expected END_TOKEN
there was more to this armor than he’d ever imagined END_TOKEN
maybe he wasn’t any better with the plate than some old gaffer , but he would change that END_TOKEN
at that moment , he determined that he’d never be surprised again END_TOKEN
he’d wear this plate morning and night—he’d sleep in the storming stuff—until he was more comfortable in it than out END_TOKEN
he raised the wooden door and swung it like a bludgeon , sweeping soldiers away and opening a path to the catapults END_TOKEN
then he dashed forward and grabbed the side of one catapult END_TOKEN
he ripped its wheel off , splintering wood and sending the machine teetering END_TOKEN
he stepped onto it , grabbing the catapult’s arm and breaking it free END_TOKEN
he stood atop the wrecked machine when he heard a distant voice call his name END_TOKEN
he looked toward the wall , where sadeas reached back and heaved his shardbearer’s hammer END_TOKEN
it spun in the air before slamming into the catapult next to dalinar , wedging itself into the broken wood END_TOKEN
sadeas raised a hand in salute , and dalinar waved back in gratitude , then grabbed the hammer END_TOKEN
the destruction went a lot faster after that END_TOKEN
he pounded the machines , leaving behind shattered wood END_TOKEN
engineers—many of them women—scrambled away , screaming , blackthorn , blackthorn END_TOKEN
by the time he neared the last catapult , gavilar had secured the gates and opened them to his soldiers END_TOKEN
a flood of men entered , joining those who had scaled the walls END_TOKEN
the last of the enemies near dalinar fled down into the city , leaving him alone END_TOKEN
he grunted and kicked the final broken catapult , sending it rolling backward across the stone toward the edge of the rift END_TOKEN
it tipped , then fell over END_TOKEN
dalinar stepped forward , walking onto a kind of observation post , a section of rock with a railing to prevent people from slipping over the side END_TOKEN
from this vantage , he got his first good look down at the city END_TOKEN
the rift was a fitting name END_TOKEN
to his right , the chasm narrowed , but here at the middle he’d have been hard - pressed to throw a stone across to the other side , even with shardplate END_TOKEN
and within it , there was life END_TOKEN
buildings built practically on top of one another down the v - shaped cliff sides END_TOKEN
the place teemed with a network of stilts , bridges , and wooden walkways END_TOKEN
dalinar turned and looked back at the wall that ran in a wide circle around the opening of the rift on all sides except the west , where the canyon continued until it opened up below at the shores of the lake END_TOKEN
to survive in alethkar , you had to find shelter from the storms END_TOKEN
a wide cleft like this one was perfect for a city END_TOKEN
but how did you protect it END_TOKEN
any attacking enemy would have the high ground END_TOKEN
many cities walked a risky line between security from storms and security from men END_TOKEN
dalinar shouldered sadeas’s hammer as groups of tanalan’s soldiers flooded down from the walls , forming up to flank gavilar’s army on both right and left END_TOKEN
they’d try to press against the kholin troops from both sides , but with three shardbearers to face , they were in trouble END_TOKEN
behind , thakka approached with a small squad of elites , joining dalinar on the stone viewing platform END_TOKEN
thakka put his hands on the railing , whistling softly END_TOKEN
something’s going on with this city , dalinar said END_TOKEN
… dalinar might not pay attention to the grand plans gavilar and sadeas made , but he was a soldier END_TOKEN
he knew battlefields like a woman knew her mother’s recipes : he might not be able to give you measurements , but he could taste when something was off END_TOKEN
the fighting continued behind him , kholin soldiers clashing with tanalan’s defenders END_TOKEN
tanalan’s armies didn’t fare well ; demoralized by the advancing kholin army , the enemy ranks quickly broke and scrambled into a retreat , clogging the ramps down into the city END_TOKEN
gavilar and sadeas didn’t give chase ; they had the high ground now END_TOKEN
no need to rush into a potential ambush END_TOKEN
gavilar clomped across the stone , sadeas beside him END_TOKEN
they’d want to survey the city and rain arrows upon those below—maybe even use stolen catapults , if dalinar had left any functional END_TOKEN
they’d siege this place until it broke END_TOKEN
tanalan has to be planning to deal with us somehow END_TOKEN
this viewing platform was the best vantage for looking into the city END_TOKEN
and they’d situated the catapults right next to it—machines that the shardbearers were certain to attack and disable END_TOKEN
dalinar glanced to the sides , and saw cracks in the stone floor of the viewing platform END_TOKEN
the enemy must have been watching , for the moment he shouted , the ground fell out from beneath him END_TOKEN
dalinar caught a glimpse of gavilar— held back by sadeas—looking on in horror as dalinar , thakka , and a handful of other elites were toppled into the rift END_TOKEN
the entire section of stone where they’d been standing—the lip hanging out over the rift—had broken free END_TOKEN
as the large section of rock tumbled down into the first buildings , dalinar was flung into the air above the city END_TOKEN
a moment later , he crashed into a building with an awful crunch END_TOKEN
something hard hit his arm , an impact so powerful he heard his armor there shatter END_TOKEN
the building failed to stop him END_TOKEN
he tore right through the wood and continued , helm grinding against stone as he somehow came in contact with the side of the rift END_TOKEN
he hit another surface with a loud crunch , and blessedly here he finally stopped END_TOKEN
he groaned , feeling a sharp pain from his left hand END_TOKEN
he shook his head , and found himself staring upward some fifty feet through a shattered section of the near - vertical wooden city END_TOKEN
the large section of falling rock had torn a swath through the city along the steep incline , smashing homes and walkways END_TOKEN
dalinar had been flung just to the north , and had eventually come to rest on the wooden roof of a building END_TOKEN
he didn’t see signs of his men END_TOKEN
but without shardplate… he growled , angerspren boiling around him like pools of blood END_TOKEN
he shifted on the rooftop , but the pain in his hand made him wince END_TOKEN
his armor all down his left arm had shattered , and in falling he appeared to have broken a few fingers END_TOKEN
his shardplate leaked glowing white smoke from a hundred fractures , but the only pieces he’d lost completely were from his left arm and hand END_TOKEN
he gingerly pried himself from the rooftop , but as he shifted , he broke through and fell into the home END_TOKEN
he grunted as he hit , members of a family screaming and pulling back against the wall END_TOKEN
tanalan apparently hadn’t told the people of his plan to crush a section of his own city in a desperate attempt to deal with the enemy shardbearers END_TOKEN
dalinar got to his feet , ignoring the cowering people , and shoved open the door—breaking it with the strength of his push—and stepped out onto a wooden walkway that ran before the homes on this tier of the city END_TOKEN
a hail of arrows immediately fell on him END_TOKEN
he turned his right shoulder toward them , growling , shielding his eye slit as best he could while he inspected the source of the attack END_TOKEN
fifty archers were set up on a garden platform on the other storming side of the rift from him END_TOKEN
he recognized the man leading the archers END_TOKEN
tall , with an imperious bearing and stark white plumes on his helm END_TOKEN
who put chicken feathers on their helms END_TOKEN
well , tanalan was a fine enough fellow END_TOKEN
dalinar had beat him once at pawns , and tanalan had paid the bet with a hundred glowing bits of ruby , each dropped into a corked bottle of wine END_TOKEN
dalinar had always found that amusing END_TOKEN
reveling in the thrill , which rose in him and drove away pain , dalinar charged along the walkway , ignoring arrows END_TOKEN
above , sadeas was leading a force down one of the ramps outside the path of the rockfall , but it would be slow going END_TOKEN
by the time they arrived , dalinar intended to have a new shardblade END_TOKEN
he charged onto one of the bridges that crossed the rift END_TOKEN
unfortunately , he knew exactly what he would do if preparing this city for an assault END_TOKEN
sure enough , a pair of soldiers hurried down the other side of the rift , then used axes to attack the support posts to dalinar’s bridge END_TOKEN
it had soulcast metal ropes holding it up , but if they could get those posts down—dropping the lines—his weight would surely cause the entire thing to fall END_TOKEN
the bottom wash of the rift was easily another hundred feet below END_TOKEN
growling , dalinar made the only choice he could END_TOKEN
he threw himself over the side of his walkway , dropping a short distance to one below END_TOKEN
even so , one foot smashed through the wooden planks , nearly followed by his entire body END_TOKEN
he heaved himself up and continued running across END_TOKEN
two more soldiers reached the posts holding up this bridge , and they began frantically hacking away END_TOKEN
the walkway shook beneath dalinar’s feet END_TOKEN
he didn’t have much time , but there were no more walkways within jumping distance END_TOKEN
dalinar pushed himself to a run , roaring , his footfalls cracking boards END_TOKEN
a single black arrow fell from above , swooping like a skyeel END_TOKEN
it dropped one of the soldiers END_TOKEN
another arrow followed , hitting the second soldier even as he gawked at his fallen ally END_TOKEN
the walkway stopped shaking , and dalinar grinned , pulling to a stop END_TOKEN
he turned , spotting a man standing near the sheared - off section of stone above END_TOKEN
he lifted a black bow toward dalinar END_TOKEN
teleb , you storming miracle , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he reached the other side and plucked an axe from the hands of a dead man END_TOKEN
then he charged up a ramp toward where he’d seen highlord tanalan END_TOKEN
he found the place easily , a wide wooden platform built on struts connected to parts of the wall below , and draped with vines and blooming rockbuds END_TOKEN
lifespren scattered as dalinar reached it END_TOKEN
centered in the garden , tanalan waited with a force of some fifty soldiers END_TOKEN
puffing inside his helm , dalinar stepped up to confront them END_TOKEN
tanalan was armored in simple steel , no shardplate , though a brutal - looking shardblade—wide , with a hooked tip—appeared in his grasp END_TOKEN
tanalan barked for his soldiers to stand back and lower their bows END_TOKEN
then he strode toward dalinar , holding the shardblade with both hands END_TOKEN
specific weapons had lore dedicated to them , and people traced which kings or brightlords had carried which sword END_TOKEN
well , dalinar had used both blade and plate , and if given the choice of one , he’d pick plate every time END_TOKEN
all he needed to do was get in one solid hit on tanalan , and the fight would be over END_TOKEN
the highlord , however , had to contend with a foe who could resist his blows END_TOKEN
standing between two squat trees , he set his stance , keeping his exposed left arm pointed away from the highlord while gripping the axe in his gauntleted right hand END_TOKEN
though it was a war axe , it felt like a child’s plaything END_TOKEN
you should not have come here , dalinar , tanalan said END_TOKEN
his voice bore a distinctively nasal accent common to this region END_TOKEN
the rifters always had considered themselves a people apart END_TOKEN
we had no quarrel with you or yours END_TOKEN
you refused to submit to the king , dalinar said , armor plates clinking as he rounded the highlord while trying to keep an eye on the soldiers END_TOKEN
he wouldn’t put it past them to attack him once he was distracted by the duel END_TOKEN
it was what he himself would have done END_TOKEN
tanalan demanded , angerspren boiling up around him END_TOKEN
there hasn’t been a throne in alethkar for generations END_TOKEN
even if we were to have a king again , who is to say the kholins deserve the mantle END_TOKEN
the way i see it , dalinar said , the people of alethkar deserve a king who is the strongest and most capable of leading them in battle END_TOKEN
if only there were a way to prove that END_TOKEN
tanalan attacked , sweeping in with his shardblade and trying to leverage his superior reach END_TOKEN
dalinar danced back , waiting for his moment END_TOKEN
the thrill was a heady rush , a lust to prove himself END_TOKEN
but he needed to be cautious END_TOKEN
ideally dalinar would prolong this fight , relying on his plate’s superior strength and the stamina it provided END_TOKEN
unfortunately , that plate was still leaking , and he had all these guards to deal with END_TOKEN
still , he tried to play it as tanalan would expect , dodging attacks , acting as if he were going to drag out the fight END_TOKEN
tanalan growled and came in again END_TOKEN
dalinar blocked the blow with his arm , then made a perfunctory swing with his axe END_TOKEN
stormfather , that blade was long END_TOKEN
almost as tall as dalinar was END_TOKEN
dalinar maneuvered , brushing against the foliage of the garden END_TOKEN
he couldn’t even feel the pain of his broken fingers anymore END_TOKEN
act like you’re drawing this out as long as possible END_TOKEN
tanalan advanced again , and dalinar dodged backward , faster because of his plate END_TOKEN
and then when tanalan tried his next strike , dalinar ducked toward him END_TOKEN
he deflected the shardblade with his arm again , but this blow hit hard , shattering the arm plate END_TOKEN
still , dalinar’s surprise rush let him lower his shoulder and slam it against tanalan END_TOKEN
the highlord’s armor clanged , bending before the force of the shardplate , and the highlord tripped END_TOKEN
unfortunately , dalinar was off balance just enough from his rush to fall alongside the highlord END_TOKEN
the platform shook as they hit the ground , the wood cracking and groaning END_TOKEN
dalinar had not wanted to go to the ground while surrounded by foes END_TOKEN
still , he had to stay inside the reach of that blade END_TOKEN
dalinar dropped off his right gauntlet—without the arm piece connecting it to the rest of the armor , it was dead weight—as the two of them twisted in a heap END_TOKEN
he’d lost the axe , unfortunately END_TOKEN
the highlord battered against dalinar with the pommel of his sword , to no effect END_TOKEN
but with one hand broken and the other lacking the power of plate , dalinar couldn’t get a good hold on his foe END_TOKEN
dalinar rolled , finally positioning himself above tanalan , where the weight of the shardplate would keep his foe pinned END_TOKEN
at that moment though , the other soldiers attacked END_TOKEN
honorable duels like this—on a battlefield at least—always lasted only until your lighteyes was losing END_TOKEN
the soldiers obviously weren’t ready for how quickly he responded END_TOKEN
he got to his feet and scooped up his axe , then lashed out END_TOKEN
his right arm still had the pauldron and down to the elbow brace , so when he swung , he had power—a strange mix of shard - enhanced strength and frailty from his exposed arms END_TOKEN
he had to be careful not to snap his own wrist END_TOKEN
he dropped three men with a flurry of axe slices END_TOKEN
the others backed away , blocking him with polearms as their fellows helped tanalan to his feet END_TOKEN
you speak of the people , tanalan said hoarsely , gauntleted hand feeling at his chest where the cuirass had been bent significantly by dalinar’s rush END_TOKEN
he seemed to be having trouble breathing END_TOKEN
as if this were about them END_TOKEN
as if it were for their good that you loot , you pillage , you murder END_TOKEN
you can’t civilize war , dalinar said END_TOKEN
there’s no painting it up and making it pretty END_TOKEN
you don’t have to pull sorrow behind you like a sledge on the stones , scraping and crushing those you pass END_TOKEN
i’m a soldier , dalinar said , eyeing tanalan’s men , many of whom were preparing their bows END_TOKEN
but i can do alethkar one last service END_TOKEN
i can take you down , you bastard END_TOKEN
dalinar roared and threw himself to the ground , hitting the platform with the weight of shardplate END_TOKEN
the wood cracked around him , weakened by the fighting earlier , and he broke through it , shattering struts underneath END_TOKEN
the entire platform came crashing down around him , and together they fell toward the tier below END_TOKEN
dalinar heard screams , and he hit the next walkway hard enough to daze him , even with shardplate END_TOKEN
dalinar shook his head , groaning , and found his helm cracked right down the front , the uncommon vision granted by the armor spoiled END_TOKEN
he pulled the helm free with one hand and gasped for breath END_TOKEN
storms , his good arm hurt too END_TOKEN
he glanced at it and found splinters piercing his skin , including one chunk as long as a dagger END_TOKEN
below , the few remaining soldiers who had been positioned to cut down bridges came charging up toward him END_TOKEN
he got to his feet , dazed , exhausted , but the two soldiers didn’t come for him END_TOKEN
they huddled around tanalan’s body where it had fallen from the platform above END_TOKEN
the soldiers grabbed him , then fled END_TOKEN
dalinar roared and awkwardly gave pursuit END_TOKEN
his plate moved slowly , and he stumbled through the wreckage of the fallen platform , trying to keep up with the soldiers END_TOKEN
the pain from his arms made him mad with rage END_TOKEN
but the thrill , the thrill drove him forward END_TOKEN
tanalan’s shardblade had not appeared beside his body END_TOKEN
that meant his foe still lived END_TOKEN
fortunately , most of the soldiers had been positioned to fight on the other side of the city END_TOKEN
this side was practically empty , save for huddled townspeople—he caught glimpses of them hiding in their homes END_TOKEN
dalinar limped up ramps along the side of the rift , following the men dragging their brightlord END_TOKEN
near the top , the two soldiers set their burden down beside an exposed portion of the chasm’s rock wall END_TOKEN
they did something that caused a portion of that wall to open inward , revealing a hidden door END_TOKEN
they towed their fallen brightlord into it , and two other soldiers—responding to their frantic calls—rushed out to meet dalinar , who arrived moments later END_TOKEN
helmless , dalinar saw red as he engaged them END_TOKEN
they bore weapons ; he did not END_TOKEN
they were fresh , and he had wounds nearly incapacitating both arms END_TOKEN
the fight still ended with the two soldiers on the ground , broken and bleeding END_TOKEN
dalinar kicked open the hidden door , plated legs functioning enough to smash it down END_TOKEN
he lurched into a small tunnel with diamond spheres glowing on the walls END_TOKEN
that door was covered in hardened crem on the outside , making it seem like a part of the wall END_TOKEN
if he hadn’t seen them enter , it would have taken days , maybe weeks to locate this place END_TOKEN
at the end of a short walk , he found the two soldiers he’d followed END_TOKEN
judging by the blood trail , they’d deposited their brightlord in the closed room behind them END_TOKEN
they rushed dalinar with the fatalistic determination of men who knew they were probably dead END_TOKEN
the pain in dalinar’s arms and head seemed nothing before the thrill END_TOKEN
he had rarely felt it so strong as he did now , a beautiful clarity , such a wonderful emotion END_TOKEN
he ducked forward , supernaturally quick , and used his shoulder to crush one soldier against the wall END_TOKEN
the other fell to a well - placed kick , then dalinar burst through the door beyond them END_TOKEN
tanalan lay on the ground here , blood surrounding him END_TOKEN
a beautiful woman was draped across him , weeping END_TOKEN
only one other person was in the small chamber : a young boy END_TOKEN
tears streaked the child’s face , and he struggled to lift his father’s shardblade in two hands END_TOKEN
you can’t have my daddy , the boy said , words distorted by his sorrow END_TOKEN
you… you… his voice fell to a whisper END_TOKEN
and with faith , we will win END_TOKEN
a few hours later , dalinar sat on the edge of the rift , his legs swinging over the broken city below END_TOKEN
his new shardblade rested across his lap , his plate—deformed and broken—in a heap beside him END_TOKEN
his arms were bandaged , but he’d chased away the surgeons END_TOKEN
he stared out at what seemed an empty plain , then flicked his eyes toward the signs of human life below END_TOKEN
gavilar eventually walked up , trailed by two bodyguards from dalinar’s elites , kadash and febin today END_TOKEN
gavilar waved them back , then groaned as he settled down beside dalinar , removing his helm END_TOKEN
exhaustionspren spun overhead , though—despite his fatigue—gavilar looked thoughtful END_TOKEN
with those keen , pale green eyes , he’d always seemed to know so much END_TOKEN
growing up , dalinar had simply assumed that his brother would always be right in whatever he said or did END_TOKEN
aging hadn’t much changed his opinion of the man END_TOKEN
congratulations , gavilar said , nodding toward the blade END_TOKEN
sadeas is irate it wasn’t his END_TOKEN
he’ll find one of his own eventually , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he’s too ambitious for me to believe otherwise END_TOKEN
this attack nearly cost us too much END_TOKEN
sadeas is saying we need to be more careful , not risk ourselves and our shards in solitary assaults END_TOKEN
sadeas is smart , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he reached gingerly with his right hand , the less mangled one , and raised a mug of wine to his lips END_TOKEN
it was the only drug he cared about for the pain—and maybe it would help with the shame too END_TOKEN
both feelings seemed stark , now that the thrill had receded and left him deflated END_TOKEN
what do we do with them , dalinar END_TOKEN
gavilar asked , waving down toward the crowds of civilians the soldiers were rounding up END_TOKEN
they won’t be cowed easily ; they won’t like that you killed their highlord and his heir END_TOKEN
those people will resist us for years END_TOKEN
make soldiers of them , he said END_TOKEN
tell them we’ll spare their families if they fight for us END_TOKEN
you want to stop doing a shardbearer rush at the start of battles END_TOKEN
sounds like we’ll need some expendable troops END_TOKEN
sadeas is right about other things too , you know END_TOKEN
and what we’re going to have to become END_TOKEN
don’t talk to me about that END_TOKEN
i lost half my elites today , my captain included END_TOKEN
why are we here , fighting END_TOKEN
we can’t just keep acting like a bunch of thugs , gavilar said END_TOKEN
we can’t rob every city we pass , feast every night END_TOKEN
we need discipline ; we need to hold the land we have END_TOKEN
we need bureaucracy , order , laws , politics END_TOKEN
dalinar closed his eyes , distracted by the shame he felt END_TOKEN
we’re going to have to grow up , gavilar said softly END_TOKEN
that’s why we started , isn’t it END_TOKEN
because they were all lazy , fat , corrupt END_TOKEN
i’m a father now , dalinar END_TOKEN
that makes me wonder about what we do once we have it all END_TOKEN
how do we make a kingdom of this place END_TOKEN
for the first time in his life , dalinar found that idea horrifying END_TOKEN
gavilar eventually stood up , responding to some messengers who were calling for him END_TOKEN
could you , he said to dalinar , at least try to be a little less foolhardy in future battles END_TOKEN
a thoughtful me , gavilar said END_TOKEN
storms , didn’t you listen to anything last night END_TOKEN
he had been the last man to unite alethkar , centuries ago END_TOKEN
dalinar shifted the blade in his lap , letting the light play off the pristine metal END_TOKEN
it’s yours now , gavilar said END_TOKEN
by the time we’re done , i’ll have it so that nobody even thinks of sunmaker anymore END_TOKEN
dalinar rammed the shardblade into the stone and leaned back , closing his eyes again and remembering the sound of a brave boy crying END_TOKEN
i ask not that you forgive me END_TOKEN
dalinar stood beside the glass windows in an upper - floor room of urithiru , hands clasped behind his back END_TOKEN
he could see his reflection hinted in the window , and beyond it vast openness END_TOKEN
the sky cloud - free , the sun burning white END_TOKEN
windows as tall as he was—he’d never seen anything like them END_TOKEN
who would dare build something of glass , so brittle , and face it toward the storms END_TOKEN
but of course , this city was above the storms END_TOKEN
these windows seemed a mark of defiance , a symbol of what the radiants had meant END_TOKEN
they had stood above the pettiness of world politics END_TOKEN
and because of that height , they could see so far END_TOKEN
you idealize them , said a distant voice in his head , like rumbling thunder END_TOKEN
i find that encouraging , dalinar whispered back END_TOKEN
if they were like us , then it means we can be like them END_TOKEN
some things are better left forgotten , the voice said to him END_TOKEN
you of all men should understand this , considering the hole in your mind and the person who once filled it END_TOKEN
dalinar drew in a sharp breath , stung by the words END_TOKEN
brightlord , brightness kalami said from behind END_TOKEN
the emperor is ready for you END_TOKEN
urithiru’s upper levels held several unique rooms , including this amphitheater END_TOKEN
shaped like a half - moon , the room had windows at the top—the straight side—then rows of seats leading down to a speaking floor below END_TOKEN
curiously , each seat had a small pedestal beside it END_TOKEN
for the radiant’s spren , the stormfather told him END_TOKEN
dalinar started down the steps toward his team : aladar and his daughter , may END_TOKEN
navani , wearing a bright green havah , sitting in the front row with feet stretched out before her , shoes off and ankles crossed END_TOKEN
elderly kalami to write , and teshav khal—one of alethkar’s finest political minds—to advise END_TOKEN
her two senior wards sat beside her , ready to provide research or translation if needed END_TOKEN
a small group , prepared to change the world END_TOKEN
send my greetings to the emperor , dalinar instructed END_TOKEN
then she cleared her throat , reading the response that the spanreed—writing as if on its own—relayed END_TOKEN
you are greeted by his imperial majesty ch END_TOKEN
yanagawn the first , emperor of makabak , king of azir , lord of the bronze palace , prime aqasix , grand minister and emissary of yaezir END_TOKEN
an imposing title , navani noted , for a fifteen - year - old boy END_TOKEN
he supposedly raised a child from the dead , teshav said , a miracle that gained him the support of the viziers END_TOKEN
local word is that they had trouble finding a new prime after the last two were murdered by our old friend the assassin in white END_TOKEN
so the viziers picked a boy with questionable lineage and made up a story about him saving someone’s life in order to demonstrate a divine mandate END_TOKEN
making things up doesn’t sound very azish END_TOKEN
they’re fine with it , navani said , as long as you can find witnesses willing to fill out affidavits END_TOKEN
kalami , thank his imperial majesty for meeting with us , and his translators for their efforts END_TOKEN
kalami wrote , and then she looked up at dalinar , who began to pace the center of the room END_TOKEN
navani stood to join him , eschewing her shoes , walking in socks END_TOKEN
your imperial majesty , dalinar said , i speak to you from the top of urithiru , city of legend END_TOKEN
i invite you to visit me here and tour the city END_TOKEN
you are welcome to bring any guards or retinue you see fit END_TOKEN
he looked to navani , and she nodded END_TOKEN
they’d discussed long how to approach the monarchs , and had settled on a soft invitation END_TOKEN
azir was first , the most powerful country in the west and home to what would be the most central and important of the oathgates to secure END_TOKEN
the azish government was a kind of beautiful mess , though gavilar had often admired it END_TOKEN
layers of clerics filled all levels— where both men and women wrote END_TOKEN
scions were kind of like ardents , though they weren’t slaves , which dalinar found odd END_TOKEN
in azir , being a priestminister in the government was the highest honor to which one could aspire END_TOKEN
traditionally , the azish prime claimed to be emperor of all makabak—a region that included over a half - dozen kingdoms and princedoms END_TOKEN
in reality , he was king over only azir , but azir did cast a long , long shadow END_TOKEN
as they waited , dalinar stepped up beside navani , resting his fingers on one of her shoulders , then drew them across her back , the nape of her neck , and let them linger on the other shoulder END_TOKEN
who would have thought a man his age could feel so giddy END_TOKEN
‘your highness , ’ the reply finally came , kalami reading the words END_TOKEN
‘we thank you for your warning about the storm that blew from the wrong direction END_TOKEN
your timely words have been noted and recorded in the official annals of the empire , recognizing you as a friend to azir END_TOKEN
kalami waited for more , but the spanreed stopped moving END_TOKEN
then the ruby flashed , indicating that they were done END_TOKEN
that wasn’t much of a response , aladar said END_TOKEN
why didn’t he reply to your invitation , dalinar END_TOKEN
being noted in their offi ial records is a great honor to the azish , teshav said , so they’ve paid you a compliment END_TOKEN
yes , navani said , but they are trying to dodge the offer we made END_TOKEN
kalami , please send the following , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i am honored , though i wish my inclusion in your annals could have been due to happier circumstances END_TOKEN
let us discuss the future of roshar together , here END_TOKEN
i am eager to make your personal acquaintance END_TOKEN
they waited as patiently as they could for a response END_TOKEN
it finally came , in alethi END_TOKEN
‘we of the azish crown are saddened to share mourning for the fallen with you END_TOKEN
as your noble brother was killed by the shin destroyer , so were beloved members of our court END_TOKEN
this creates a bond between us END_TOKEN
they’re not going to be pushed into an answer END_TOKEN
they could at least explain themselves END_TOKEN
it feels like we’re having two different conversations END_TOKEN
the azish , teshav said , do not like to give offense END_TOKEN
they’re almost as bad as the emuli in that regard , particularly with foreigners END_TOKEN
it wasn’t only an azish attribute , in dalinar’s estimation END_TOKEN
it was the way of politicians worldwide END_TOKEN
already this conversation was starting to feel like his efforts to bring the highprinces to his side , back in the warcamps END_TOKEN
half answer after half answer , mild promises with no bite to them , laughing eyes that mocked him even while they pretended to be perfectly sincere END_TOKEN
trying to unite people who didn’t want to listen to him END_TOKEN
he couldn’t afford to be bad at this , not any longer END_TOKEN
there was a time , he thought , when i united in a different way END_TOKEN
he smelled smoke , heard men screaming in pain END_TOKEN
remembered bringing blood and ash to those who defied his brother END_TOKEN
those memories had become particularly vivid lately END_TOKEN
instead of an invitation , try an offer of aid END_TOKEN
your imperial majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
war is coming ; surely you have seen the changes in the parshmen END_TOKEN
i would have you know that the alethi are your allies in this conflict END_TOKEN
we would share information regarding our successes and failures in resisting this enemy , with hope that you will report the same to us END_TOKEN
mankind must be unified in the face of the mounting threat END_TOKEN
the reply eventually came : ‘we agree that aiding one another in this new age will be of the utmost importance END_TOKEN
we are glad to exchange information END_TOKEN
what do you know of these transformed parshmen END_TOKEN
we engaged them on the shattered plains , dalinar said , relieved to make some kind of headway END_TOKEN
creatures with red eyes , and similar in many ways to the parshmen we found on the shattered plains—only more dangerous END_TOKEN
i will have my scribes prepare reports for you detailing all we have learned in fighting the parshendi over the years END_TOKEN
‘excellent , ’ the reply finally came END_TOKEN
‘this information will be extremely welcome in our current conflict END_TOKEN
what is the status of your cities END_TOKEN
what have the parshmen been doing there END_TOKEN
do they seem to have a goal beyond wanton destruction END_TOKEN
tensely , they waited for word END_TOKEN
so far they’d been able to discover blessed little about the parshmen the world over END_TOKEN
captain kaladin sent reports using scribes from towns he visited , but knew next to nothing END_TOKEN
cities were in chaos , and reliable information scarce END_TOKEN
‘fortunately , ’ came the reply , ‘our city stands , and the enemy is not actively attacking any longer END_TOKEN
we are negotiating with the hostiles END_TOKEN
he turned to teshav , who shook her head in wonder END_TOKEN
please clarify , your majesty , navani said END_TOKEN
the voidbringers are willing to negotiate with you END_TOKEN
‘yes , ’ came the reply END_TOKEN
they have very detailed demands , with outrageous stipulations END_TOKEN
we hope that we can forestall armed conflict in order to gather ourselves and fortify the city END_TOKEN
the voidbringers themselves are sending you contracts END_TOKEN
‘the average parshman cannot write , so far as we can tell , ’ the reply came END_TOKEN
‘but some are different—stronger , with strange powers END_TOKEN
they do not speak like the others END_TOKEN
your majesty , dalinar said , stepping up to the spanreed writing table , speaking more urgently—as if the emperor and his ministers could hear his passion through the written word END_TOKEN
i need to talk to you directly END_TOKEN
i can come myself , through the portal we wrote of earlier END_TOKEN
we must get it working again END_TOKEN
it stretched so long that dalinar found himself grinding his teeth , itching to summon a shardblade and dismiss it , over and over , as had been his habit as a youth END_TOKEN
he’d picked it up from his brother END_TOKEN
‘we regret to inform you that the device you mention , ’ kalami read , ‘is not functional in our city END_TOKEN
we have investigated it , and have found that it was destroyed long ago END_TOKEN
we cannot come to you , nor you to us END_TOKEN
that’s information we could have used as soon as he learned it END_TOKEN
it’s a lie , navani said END_TOKEN
the oathgate on the shattered plains functioned after centuries of storms and crem buildup END_TOKEN
the one in azimir is a monument in the grand market , a large dome in the center of the city END_TOKEN
or so she’d determined from maps END_TOKEN
the one in kholinar had been incorporated into the palace structure , while the one in thaylen city was some kind of religious monument END_TOKEN
a beautiful relic like this wouldn’t simply be destroyed END_TOKEN
i agree with brightness navani’s assessment , teshav said END_TOKEN
they are worried about the idea of you or your armies visiting END_TOKEN
she frowned , as if the emperor and his ministers were little more than spoiled children disobeying their tutors END_TOKEN
it’s an affidavit , navani said , amused END_TOKEN
that the oathgate is not functional , signed by imperial architects and stormwardens END_TOKEN
only the azish would assume you’d want certification that something is broken END_TOKEN
notably , kalami added , it only certifies that the device ‘does not function as a portal END_TOKEN
’ but of course it would not , not unless a radiant were to visit and work it END_TOKEN
this affidavit basically says that when turned off , the device doesn’t work END_TOKEN
write this , kalami , dalinar said END_TOKEN
destruction caused by the everstorm was the result END_TOKEN
you cannot negotiate with the voidbringers END_TOKEN
we must unify , share information , and protect roshar END_TOKEN
she wrote it and dalinar waited , hands pressed against the table END_TOKEN
‘we misspoke when we mentioned negotiations , ’ kalami read END_TOKEN
‘it was a mistake of translation END_TOKEN
we agree to share information , but time is short right now END_TOKEN
we will contact you again to further discuss END_TOKEN
dalinar said , pushing himself back from the table END_TOKEN
storming lighteyes and damnation’s own politics END_TOKEN
he stalked across the room , wishing he had something to kick , before forcing his temper under control END_TOKEN
that’s more of a stonewall than i expected , navani said , folding her arms END_TOKEN
in my experiences with the azish , teshav said , they are extremely proficient at saying very little in as many words as possible END_TOKEN
this is not an unusual example of communication with their upper ministers END_TOKEN
don’t be put off ; it will take time to accomplish anything with them END_TOKEN
time during which roshar burns , dalinar said END_TOKEN
why did they pull back regarding their claim to have had negotiations with the voidbringers END_TOKEN
are they thinking of allying themselves to the enemy END_TOKEN
i hesitate to guess , teshav said END_TOKEN
but i would say that they simply decided they’d given away more information than intended END_TOKEN
we need azir , dalinar said END_TOKEN
nobody in makabak will listen to us unless we have azir’s blessing , not to mention that oathgate END_TOKEN
… he trailed off as a different spanreed on the table started blinking END_TOKEN
it’s the thaylens , kalami said END_TOKEN
no , we can’t afford to wait another few days before the queen can spare time again END_TOKEN
storms , talking to politicians was more exhausting than a hundred - mile march in full armor END_TOKEN
navani settled down on one of the seats , though dalinar remained standing END_TOKEN
light poured in through the windows , pure and bright END_TOKEN
it flowed down , bathing him END_TOKEN
he breathed in , almost feeling as if he could taste the sunlight END_TOKEN
he’d spent too many days inside the twisting stone corridors of urithiru , lit by the frail light of candles and lamps END_TOKEN
‘her royal highness , ’ kalami read , ‘brightness fen rnamdi , queen of thaylenah , writes to you END_TOKEN
brightlord… pardon the interruption , but that indicates that the queen holds the spanreed herself rather than using a scribe END_TOKEN
to another woman , that would have been intimidating END_TOKEN
to kalami , it was merely one of many footnotes—which she added copiously to the bottom of the page before preparing the reed to relay dalinar’s words END_TOKEN
your majesty , dalinar said , clasping his hands behind his back and pacing the stage at the center of the seats END_TOKEN
i send you greetings from urithiru , holy city of the knights radiant , and extend to you our humblest invitation END_TOKEN
this tower is truly a sight to behold , matched only by the glory of a sitting monarch END_TOKEN
i would be honored to present it for you to experience END_TOKEN
the spanreed quickly scribbled a reply END_TOKEN
queen fen was writing directly in alethi END_TOKEN
‘kholin , ’ kalami read , ‘you old brute END_TOKEN
i always did like her , navani noted END_TOKEN
i’m being sincere , your majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
my only desire is for us to meet in person , and to talk to you and show you what we’ve discovered END_TOKEN
the world is changing around us END_TOKEN
‘oh , ’ came the reply , ‘the world is changing , is it END_TOKEN
what led you to this incredible conclusion END_TOKEN
was it the fact that our slaves suddenly became voidbringers , or was it perhaps the storm that blew the wrong way , ’—she wrote that twice as large as the line around it , brightlord—‘ripping our cities apart END_TOKEN
her majesty seems to be having a bad day END_TOKEN
she’s insulting us , navani said END_TOKEN
for fen , that actually implies a good day END_TOKEN
she’s always been perfectly civil the few times i’ve met her , dalinar said with a frown END_TOKEN
she was being queenly then , navani said END_TOKEN
you’ve got her talking to you directly END_TOKEN
trust me , it’s a good sign END_TOKEN
your majesty , dalinar said , please tell me of your parshmen END_TOKEN
‘storming monsters stole our best ships—almost everything in the harbor from single - masted sloops on up—and escaped the city END_TOKEN
‘there were some scuffles , ’ fen wrote , ‘but most everyone was too busy dealing with the eff cts of the storm END_TOKEN
by the time we got things somewhat sorted out , they were sailing away in a grand fleet of royal warships and private trading vessels alike END_TOKEN
we don’t know half as much about the voidbringers as we assumed END_TOKEN
you might remember that we warned you about the imminent arrival of that storm END_TOKEN
‘i believed you , ’ fen said END_TOKEN
‘if only because we got word from new natanan confirming it END_TOKEN
we tried to prepare , but a nation cannot upend four millennia worth of tradition at a snap of the fingers END_TOKEN
thaylen city is a shambles , kholin END_TOKEN
the storm broke our aqueducts and sewer systems , and ripped apart our docks—flattened the entire outer market END_TOKEN
we have to fix all our cisterns , reinforce our buildings to withstand storms , and rebuild society—all without any parshman laborers and in the middle of the storming weeping END_TOKEN
i don’t have time for sightseeing END_TOKEN
it’s hardly sightseeing , your majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i am aware of your problems , and dire though they are , we cannot ignore the voidbringers END_TOKEN
i intend to convene a grand conference of kings to fight this threat END_TOKEN
‘led by you , ’ fen wrote in reply END_TOKEN
urithiru is the natural location for a meeting , dalinar said END_TOKEN
your majesty , the knights radiant have returned—we speak again their ancient oaths , and bind the surges of nature to us END_TOKEN
if we can restore your oathgate to functionality , you can be here in an afternoon , then return the same evening to direct the needs of your city END_TOKEN
navani nodded at this tactic , though aladar folded his arms , looking thoughtful END_TOKEN
dalinar asked him as kalami wrote END_TOKEN
we need a radiant to travel to the city to activate their oathgate , right END_TOKEN
a radiant needs to unlock the gate on this side— which we can do at any moment—then one has to travel to the destination city and undo the lock there as well END_TOKEN
that done , a radiant can initiate a transfer from either location END_TOKEN
then the only one we have that can theoretically get to thaylen city is the windrunner , aladar said END_TOKEN
but what if it takes him months to get back here END_TOKEN
or what if he’s captured by the enemy END_TOKEN
can we even make good on our promises , dalinar END_TOKEN
a troubling problem , but one that dalinar thought he might have an answer to END_TOKEN
there was a weapon that he’d decided to keep hidden for now END_TOKEN
it might work as well as a radiant’s shardblade in opening the oathgates— and might let someone reach thaylen city by flight END_TOKEN
that was moot for the time being END_TOKEN
first he needed a willing ear on the other side of the spanreed END_TOKEN
‘i will admit that my merchants are intrigued by these oathgates END_TOKEN
we have lore surrounding them here , that the one most passionate could cause the portal of worlds to open again END_TOKEN
i think every girl in thaylenah dreams of being the one to invoke it END_TOKEN
the passions , navani said with a downward turn of her lips END_TOKEN
the thaylens had a pagan pseudo - religion , and that had always been a curious aspect in dealing with them END_TOKEN
they would praise the heralds one moment , then speak of the passions the next END_TOKEN
well , dalinar wasn’t one to fault another for unconventional beliefs END_TOKEN
‘if you want to send me what you know about these oathgates , well , that sounds great , ’ fen continued END_TOKEN
‘but i’m not interested in some grand conference of kings END_TOKEN
you let me know what you boys come up with , because i’m going to be here frantically trying to rebuild my city END_TOKEN
well , aladar said , at least we finally got an honest response END_TOKEN
i’m not convinced this is honest , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he rubbed his chin , thinking END_TOKEN
he’d only met this woman a few times , but something seemed off about her responses END_TOKEN
i agree , brightlord , teshav said END_TOKEN
i think any thaylen would jump at the chance to come pull strings at a meeting of monarchs , if only to see if she can find a way to get trade deals out of them END_TOKEN
she is most certainly hiding something END_TOKEN
offer troops , navani said , to help her rebuild END_TOKEN
your majesty , dalinar said , i am deeply grieved to hear of your losses END_TOKEN
i have many soldiers here who are currently unoccupied END_TOKEN
i would gladly send you a battalion to help repair your city END_TOKEN
the reply was slow in coming END_TOKEN
‘i’m not sure what i think of having alethi troops on my stone , well intentioned or not END_TOKEN
everyone knows alethi and ships don’t mix END_TOKEN
she’s not worried about us arriving on ships , dalinar said END_TOKEN
she’s worried about an army of troops suddenly materializing in the center of her city END_TOKEN
if dalinar had the inclination , he could send a windrunner to secretly open a city’s oathgate , and invade in an unprecedented assault that appeared right behind enemy lines END_TOKEN
he needed allies , not subjects , so he wouldn’t do it—at least not to a potentially friendly city END_TOKEN
kholinar , however , was another story END_TOKEN
they still didn’t have reliable word of what was happening in the alethi capital END_TOKEN
but if the rioting was still going on , he’d been thinking that there might be a way to get armies in and restore order END_TOKEN
for now , he needed to focus on queen fen END_TOKEN
your majesty , he said , nodding for kalami to write , consider my offer of troops , please END_TOKEN
and as you do , might i suggest that you begin searching among your people for budding knights radiant END_TOKEN
they are the key to working oathgates END_TOKEN
we have had a number of radiants manifest near the shattered plains END_TOKEN
they are formed through an interaction with certain spren , who seem to be searching for worthy candidates END_TOKEN
i can only assume this is happening worldwide END_TOKEN
it is entirely likely that among the people of your city , someone has already spoken the oaths END_TOKEN
you’re giving up quite an advantage , dalinar , aladar noted END_TOKEN
i’m planting a seed , aladar , dalinar said END_TOKEN
and i’ll plant it on any hill i can find , regardless of who owns it END_TOKEN
we must fight as a unified people END_TOKEN
i don’t dispute that , aladar said , standing up and stretching END_TOKEN
but your knowledge of the radiants is a bargaining point , one that can perhaps draw people to you—force them to work with you END_TOKEN
give up too much , and you might find a ‘headquarters’ for the knights radiant in every major city across roshar END_TOKEN
rather than working together , you’ll have them competing to recruit END_TOKEN
dalinar hated turning knowledge into bargaining chips , but what if this was why he’d always failed in his negotiations with the highprinces END_TOKEN
he wanted to be honest , straightforward , and let the pieces fall where they may END_TOKEN
but it seemed that someone better at the game—and more willing to break the rules—always snatched the pieces from the air as he dropped them , then set them down the way they wanted END_TOKEN
and , he said quickly for kalami to add , we would be happy to send our radiants to train those you discover , then introduce them to the system and fraternity of urithiru , to which each of them has a right by nature of their oaths END_TOKEN
kalami added this , then twisted the spanreed to indicate they were done and waiting for a reply END_TOKEN
‘we will consider this , ’ kalami read as the spanreed scribbled across the page END_TOKEN
‘the crown of thaylenah thanks you for your interest in our people , and we will consider negotiations regarding your offer of troops END_TOKEN
we have sent some of our few remaining cutters to track down the fleeing parshmen , and will inform you of what we discover END_TOKEN
until we speak again , highprince END_TOKEN
we lost her somewhere in there END_TOKEN
dalinar sat down in the seat next to her and let out a long sigh END_TOKEN
i’m fine , navani , he said END_TOKEN
i can’t expect glowing commitments to cooperation on my first attempt END_TOKEN
we’ll just have to keep trying END_TOKEN
the words were more optimistic than he felt END_TOKEN
he wished he could talk to these people in person , instead of over spanreed END_TOKEN
they talked to the princess of yezier next , followed by the prince of tashikk END_TOKEN
they didn’t have oathgates , and were less essential to his plan , but he wanted to at least open lines of communication with them END_TOKEN
neither gave him more than vague answers END_TOKEN
without the azish emperor’s blessing , he wouldn’t be able to get any of the smaller makabaki kingdoms to commit END_TOKEN
perhaps the emuli or the tukari would listen , but he’d only ever get one of those two , considering their long - standing feud END_TOKEN
at the end of the last conference , aladar and his daughter excusing themselves , dalinar stretched , feeling worn down END_TOKEN
and this wasn’t the end of it END_TOKEN
he would have discussions with the monarchs of iri—it had three , strangely END_TOKEN
the oathgate at rall elorim was in their lands , making them important—and they held sway over nearby rira , which had another oathgate END_TOKEN
beyond that , of course , there were the shin to deal with END_TOKEN
they hated using spanreeds , so navani had poked at them through a thaylen merchant who had been willing to relay information END_TOKEN
dalinar’s shoulder protested as he stretched END_TOKEN
he had found middle age to be like an assassin—quiet , creeping along behind him END_TOKEN
much of the time he would go about his life as he always had , until an unexpected ache or pain gave warning END_TOKEN
he was not the youth he had once been END_TOKEN
and bless the almighty for that , he thought idly , bidding farewell to navani—who wanted to sift through information reports from various spanreed stations around the world END_TOKEN
aladar’s daughter and scribes were gathering them in bulk for her END_TOKEN
dalinar collected several of his guards , leaving others for navani should she need some extra hands , and climbed up along the rows of seats to the room’s exit at the top END_TOKEN
hovering just outside the doorway—like an axehound banished from the warmth of the fire—stood elhokar END_TOKEN
i’m glad you could make the meeting END_TOKEN
why do they refuse you , uncle END_TOKEN
elhokar asked , ignoring the question END_TOKEN
do they think perhaps you will try to usurp their thrones END_TOKEN
dalinar drew in his breath sharply , and his guards looked embarrassed to be standing nearby END_TOKEN
they backed up to give him and the king privacy END_TOKEN
you likely think i say this in spite , the king said , poking his head into the room , noting his mother , then looking back at dalinar END_TOKEN
you are better than i am END_TOKEN
a better soldier , a better person , and certainly a better king END_TOKEN
you do yourself a disservice , elhokar END_TOKEN
oh , save your platitudes , dalinar END_TOKEN
for once in your life , just be honest with me END_TOKEN
elhokar raised his hand and lightly touched his own chest END_TOKEN
perhaps you have been , at times END_TOKEN
perhaps the liar here is me—lying to tell myself i could do this , that i could be a fraction of the man my father was END_TOKEN
no , don’t interrupt me , dalinar END_TOKEN
perhaps… perhaps i’m a fine king END_TOKEN
not extraordinary , but not an abject failure END_TOKEN
but in the face of these events , the world needs better than fine END_TOKEN
there seemed a fatalism to his words , and that sent a worried shiver through dalinar END_TOKEN
elhokar , what are you saying END_TOKEN
elhokar strode into the chamber and called down to those at the bottom of the rows of seats END_TOKEN
mother , brightness teshav , would you witness something for me END_TOKEN
storms , no , dalinar thought , hurrying after elhokar END_TOKEN
we all must accept the consequences of our actions , uncle , elhokar said END_TOKEN
i’ve been learning this very slowly , as i can be as dense as a stone END_TOKEN
uncle , am i your king END_TOKEN
he knelt , shocking navani and causing her to pull to a stop three - quarters of the way up the steps END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin , elhokar said in a loud voice , i swear to you now END_TOKEN
i give an oath , immutable and witnessed , that i accept you as my monarch END_TOKEN
as alethkar is to me , i am to you END_TOKEN
dalinar breathed out , looking to navani’s aghast face , then down to his nephew , kneeling as a vassal on the floor END_TOKEN
you did ask for this , uncle , elhokar said END_TOKEN
not specifically in words , but it is the only place we could have gone END_TOKEN
you have slowly been taking command ever since you decided to trust those visions END_TOKEN
i’ve tried to include you , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he should be better than that END_TOKEN
i’m sorry , dalinar said , for your pain END_TOKEN
i’m sorry that i didn’t handle this better END_TOKEN
i’m sorry that this… this must be END_TOKEN
before you make this oath , tell me what you expect that it entails END_TOKEN
i’ve already said the words , elhokar said , growing red faced END_TOKEN
oh , stand up , dalinar said , grabbing him by the arm and hauling him to his feet END_TOKEN
if you really want to swear this oath , i’ll let you END_TOKEN
but let’s not pretend you can sweep into a room , shout a few words , and assume it’s a legal contract END_TOKEN
elhokar pulled his arm free and rubbed it END_TOKEN
won’t even let me abdicate with dignity END_TOKEN
you’re not abdicating , navani said , joining them END_TOKEN
she shot a glare at the guards , who stood watching with slack jaws , and they grew white at the glare END_TOKEN
she pointed at them as if to say , not a word of this to anyone else END_TOKEN
elhokar , you intend to shove your uncle into a position above you END_TOKEN
what will this mean for alethkar END_TOKEN
he should give up his lands to his heir END_TOKEN
dalinar is a king of somewhere else , after all END_TOKEN
dalinar , highking of urithiru , maybe the shattered plains END_TOKEN
he stood straighter , speaking more certainly END_TOKEN
dalinar must stay out of the direct management of my lands END_TOKEN
he can give me commands , but i decide how to see them accomplished END_TOKEN
it sounds reasonable , navani said , glancing at dalinar END_TOKEN
reasonable , but gut - wrenching END_TOKEN
the kingdom he’d fought for—the kingdom he’d forged in pain , exhaustion , and blood—now rejected him END_TOKEN
this is my land now , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
i can accept these terms , though at times i might need to give commands to your highprinces END_TOKEN
as long as they’re in your domain , elhokar said , a hint of stubbornness to his voice , i consider them under your authority END_TOKEN
while they visit urithiru or the shattered plains , command as you wish END_TOKEN
when they return to my kingdom , you must go through me END_TOKEN
he looked to dalinar , and then glanced down , as if embarrassed to be making demands END_TOKEN
though we need to work this out with scribes before we make the change officially END_TOKEN
and before we go too far , we should make certain there is still an alethkar for you to rule END_TOKEN
i’ve been thinking the same thing END_TOKEN
uncle , i want to lead our forces to alethkar and recapture our homeland END_TOKEN
more than these riots or my wife’s supposed behavior , more than the spanreeds going still END_TOKEN
the enemy is doing something in the city END_TOKEN
i’ll take an army to stop it , and save the kingdom END_TOKEN
dalinar had been imagining himself leading a force , cutting through the voidbringer ranks , sweeping them from alethkar and marching into kholinar to restore order END_TOKEN
truth was , though , it didn’t make sense for either of them to lead such an assault END_TOKEN
elhokar , dalinar said , leaning in END_TOKEN
the oathgate is attached to the palace itself END_TOKEN
we don’t need to march an army all the way to alethkar END_TOKEN
all we need to do is restore that device END_TOKEN
once it works , we can transport our forces into the city to secure the palace , restore order , and fend off the voidbringers END_TOKEN
get into the city , elhokar said END_TOKEN
uncle , to do that we might need an army in the first place END_TOKEN
a small team could reach kholinar far faster than an army END_TOKEN
as long as there was a radiant with them , they could sneak in , restore the oathgate , and open the way for the rest of us END_TOKEN
i’ll take a team and reclaim our home END_TOKEN
aesudan is there ; if the rioting is still happening , she’s fighting against it END_TOKEN
that wasn’t what the reports—before they’d cut off—had suggested to dalinar END_TOKEN
if anything , the queen was the cause of the riots END_TOKEN
and he certainly hadn’t been intending elhokar to go on this mission himself END_TOKEN
the lad was earnest , as he’d always been END_TOKEN
besides , elhokar seemed to have learned something from his near death at the hands of assassins END_TOKEN
he was certainly humbler now than he’d been in years past END_TOKEN
it is fitting , dalinar said , that their king should be the one who saves them END_TOKEN
i will see that you have whatever resources you need , elhokar END_TOKEN
glowing gloryspren orbs burst around elhokar END_TOKEN
i only seem to see those when i’m around you , uncle END_TOKEN
for all that i should resent you , i don’t END_TOKEN
it’s hard to resent a man who is doing his best END_TOKEN
i need one of your radiants END_TOKEN
he needs to go with me , so if i screw up and fail , someone will be there to save the city anyway END_TOKEN
i’ve had ample chances to reflect lately , uncle , elhokar said END_TOKEN
the almighty has preserved me , despite my stupidity END_TOKEN
i’ll bring the bridgeman with me , and i’ll observe him END_TOKEN
figure out why he’s so special END_TOKEN
see if he’ll teach me to be like him END_TOKEN
and if i fail… he shrugged END_TOKEN
well , alethkar is in safe hands regardless , right END_TOKEN
i need to make plans , elhokar said END_TOKEN
i’ve only just recovered from my wounds END_TOKEN
but i can’t leave until the hero returns anyway END_TOKEN
could he fly me and my chosen team to the city END_TOKEN
that would certainly be the fastest way END_TOKEN
i will want every report we’ve had from kholinar , and i need to study the oathgate device in person END_TOKEN
yes , and have drawings done comparing it to the one in the city END_TOKEN
thank you for believing in me , if only this small amount END_TOKEN
dalinar nodded to him , and elhokar retreated , a spring in his step END_TOKEN
dalinar sighed , feeling overwhelmed by the exchange END_TOKEN
navani hovered by his side as he settled down in one of the seats for the radiants , beside a pedestal for a little spren END_TOKEN
on one side , he had a king swearing to him an oath he didn’t want END_TOKEN
on the other , he had an entire group of monarchs who wouldn’t listen to his most rational of suggestions END_TOKEN
he leaped to his feet , and navani spun END_TOKEN
kalami was watching one of the spanreeds , which had started writing END_TOKEN
‘your majesty , ’ kalami read from the page , ‘i consider your off r generous , and your advice wise END_TOKEN
we have located the device you call an oathgate END_TOKEN
one of my people has come forward , and—remarkably—claims to be radiant END_TOKEN
her spren directed her to speak with me ; we plan to use her shardblade to test the device END_TOKEN
‘if it works , i will come to you in all haste END_TOKEN
it is well that someone is attempting to organize a resistance to the evils that befall us END_TOKEN
the nations of roshar must put aside their squabbles , and the reemergence of the holy city of urithiru is proof to me that the almighty guides your hand END_TOKEN
i look forward to counseling with you and adding my forces to yours in a joint operation to protect these lands END_TOKEN
’ she looked up at him , amazed END_TOKEN
it was sent by taravangian , king of jah keved and kharbranth END_TOKEN
dalinar hadn’t expected him to reply so quickly END_TOKEN
he was said to be a kindly , if somewhat simple man END_TOKEN
perfect for ruling a small city - state with the help of a governing council END_TOKEN
his elevation to king of jah keved was widely seen as an act of spite from the former king , who hadn’t wanted to give the throne to any of his rivals’ houses END_TOKEN
someone was willing to join him END_TOKEN
bless that man , bless him END_TOKEN
if dalinar failed everywhere else , at least he would have king taravangian at his side END_TOKEN
i ask only that you read or listen to these words END_TOKEN
shallan breathed out stormlight and stepped through it , feeling it envelop her , transform her END_TOKEN
she’d been moved , upon request , to sebarial’s section of urithiru , in part because he’d promised her a room with a balcony END_TOKEN
fresh air and a view of the mountain peaks END_TOKEN
if she couldn’t be completely free of this building’s shadowed depths , then at least she could have a home on the borders END_TOKEN
she pulled at her hair , pleased to see it had turned black END_TOKEN
she had become veil , a disguise she’d been working on for some time END_TOKEN
shallan held up hands that were callused and worked—even the safehand END_TOKEN
she kept her nails filed , and liked to dress nicely , keep her hair brushed END_TOKEN
she simply didn’t have time for frivolities END_TOKEN
a good sturdy coat and trousers suited veil better than a flowing havah END_TOKEN
and she had no time for an extended sleeve covering her safehand END_TOKEN
she’d wear a glove , thank you very much END_TOKEN
at the moment she was dressed in her nightgown ; she’d change later , once she was ready to sneak out into urithiru’s halls END_TOKEN
though she felt bad about the use of stormlight when everyone else was scrimping , dalinar had told her to train with her powers END_TOKEN
she strode through her chamber , adopting veil’s gait—confident and sturdy , never prim END_TOKEN
you couldn’t balance a book on veil’s head as she walked , but she’d happily balance one on your face after she knocked you unconscious END_TOKEN
she circled the room several times , crossing the patch of evening light from the window END_TOKEN
her room was ornamented by bright circular patterns of strata on the walls END_TOKEN
the stone was smooth to the touch , and a knife couldn’t scratch it END_TOKEN
there wasn’t much furniture , though shallan was hopeful that the latest scavenging expeditions to the warcamps would return with something she could appropriate from sebarial END_TOKEN
for now she did what she could with some blankets , a single stool , and—blessedly—a hand mirror END_TOKEN
she’d hung it on the wall , tied to a stone knob that she assumed was for hanging pictures END_TOKEN
she checked her face in the mirror END_TOKEN
she wanted to get to the point where she could become veil at a moment’s notice , without needing to review sketches END_TOKEN
she prodded at her features , but of course as the more angular nose and pronounced forehead were a result of lightweaving , she couldn’t feel them END_TOKEN
when she frowned , veil’s face mimicked the motion perfectly END_TOKEN
something to drink , please , she said END_TOKEN
the voice becomes a good lie END_TOKEN
veil’s voice was deeper than shallan’s , rougher END_TOKEN
she’d started to wonder , how far could she go in changing how things sounded END_TOKEN
for now , she wasn’t sure she’d gotten the lips right in the illusion END_TOKEN
she sauntered over to her art supplies and flipped open her sketchbook , looking for renditions of veil she’d drawn instead of going to dinner with sebarial and palona END_TOKEN
the first page of the sketchbook was of the corridor with the twisting strata she’d passed through the other day : lines of madness curling toward darkness END_TOKEN
she flipped to the next , a picture of one of the tower’s budding markets END_TOKEN
thousands of merchants , washwomen , prostitutes , innkeepers , and craftsmen of all varieties were setting up in urithiru END_TOKEN
shallan knew well how many—she’d been the one to bring them all through the oathgate END_TOKEN
in her sketch , the black upper reaches of the large market cavern loomed over tiny figures scurrying between tents , holding fragile lights END_TOKEN
the next was another tunnel into darkness END_TOKEN
then a room where the strata coiled about one another in a mesmerizing manner END_TOKEN
she hadn’t realized she’d done so many END_TOKEN
she flipped twenty pages before she found her sketches of veil END_TOKEN
yes , the lips were right END_TOKEN
the build was wrong , however END_TOKEN
veil had a lean strength , and that wasn’t coming through in the nightgown END_TOKEN
it looked too much like shallan’s figure beneath END_TOKEN
someone knocked on the wooden plate hung outside her rooms END_TOKEN
she had just a cloth draping the doorway right now END_TOKEN
many of the tower’s doors had warped over the years ; hers had been ripped out , and she was still waiting on a replacement END_TOKEN
the one knocking would be palona , who had once again noticed that shallan had skipped dinner END_TOKEN
shallan sucked in a breath , destroying the image of veil , recovering some of the stormlight from her lightweaving END_TOKEN
honestly , it didn’t seem to matter to palona that shallan was a storming knight radiant now , she’d still mother her all the—
adolin stepped in , carrying a large plate of food in one hand , some books under the other arm END_TOKEN
he saw her and stumbled , nearly dropping it all END_TOKEN
shallan froze , then yelped and tucked her bare safehand behind her back END_TOKEN
adolin didn’t even have the decency to blush at finding her practically naked END_TOKEN
he balanced the food in his hand , recovering from his stumble , and then grinned END_TOKEN
shallan said , waving her freehand at him END_TOKEN
he backed away awkwardly , through the draped cloth over the doorway END_TOKEN
shallan’s blush was probably so bright they could have used her as a signal to send the army to war END_TOKEN
she pulled on a glove , then wrapped that in a safepouch , then threw on the blue dress she had draped over the back of her chair and did up the sleeve END_TOKEN
she didn’t have the presence of mind to pull on her bodice vest first , not that she really needed one anyway END_TOKEN
she kicked it under a blanket instead END_TOKEN
in my defense , adolin said from outside , you did invite me in END_TOKEN
shallan said , doing up the buttons on the side of her dress—which proved difficult , with three layers covering her safehand END_TOKEN
you know , you could check to see who is at your door END_TOKEN
don’t make this my fault , shallan said END_TOKEN
you’re the one slipping into young ladies’ bedrooms practically unannounced END_TOKEN
did you knock with one hand or two END_TOKEN
i’m carrying a storming platter of food—for you , by the way END_TOKEN
of course the knock was one - handed END_TOKEN
and seriously , who knocks with two END_TOKEN
it was quite feminine , then END_TOKEN
i’d have thought that imitating a woman to catch a glimpse of a young lady in her undergarments was beneath you , adolin kholin END_TOKEN
oh , for damnation’s sake , shallan END_TOKEN
and just so we’re clear , i’m a man and your betrothed , my name is adolin kholin , i was born under the sign of the nine , i have a birthmark on the back of my left thigh , and i had crab curry for breakfast END_TOKEN
anything else you need to know END_TOKEN
she poked her head out , pulling the cloth tight around her neck END_TOKEN
back of your left thigh , eh END_TOKEN
what’s a girl got to do to sneak a glimpse of that END_TOKEN
knock like a man , apparently END_TOKEN
this dress is being a pain END_TOKEN
she ducked back into the room END_TOKEN
i’m not standing out here holding a heavy platter of food , smelling it after having skipped dinner so i could dine with you END_TOKEN
it’s good for you , shallan said END_TOKEN
isn’t that the sort of thing you do END_TOKEN
strangle rocks , stand on your head , throw boulders around END_TOKEN
yes , i have quite my share of murdered rocks stuffed under my bed END_TOKEN
shallan grabbed her dress with her teeth at the neck to pull it tight , helping with the buttons END_TOKEN
what is it with women and their undergarments anyway END_TOKEN
adolin said , the platter clinking as some of the plates slid against one another END_TOKEN
i mean , that shift covers basically the same parts as a formal dress END_TOKEN
it’s the decency of it , shallan said around a mouthful of fabric END_TOKEN
besides , certain things have a tendency to poke out through a shift END_TOKEN
oh , and men aren’t arbitrary about clothing END_TOKEN
a uniform is basically the same as any other coat , right END_TOKEN
besides , aren’t you the one who spends his afternoons searching through fashion folios END_TOKEN
he chuckled and started a reply , but shallan , finally dressed , swept back the sheet on her doorway END_TOKEN
adolin stood up from leaning against the wall of the corridor and took her in—frazzled hair , dress that she had missed two buttons on , cheeks flushed END_TOKEN
then he grinned a dopey grin END_TOKEN
ash’s eyes… he actually thought she was pretty END_TOKEN
this wonderful , princely man actually liked being with her END_TOKEN
she’d traveled to the ancient city of the knights radiant , but compared to adolin’s affection , all the sights of urithiru were dun spheres END_TOKEN
do not find a way to screw this up , shallan thought to herself as she took the books from under his arm END_TOKEN
she stepped aside , letting him enter and set the platter on the floor END_TOKEN
palona said you hadn’t eaten , he said , and then she found out i’d skipped dinner END_TOKEN
so she sent you with a lot , shallan said , inspecting the platter piled high with dishes , flatbreads , and shellfood END_TOKEN
yeah , adolin said , standing and scratching at his head END_TOKEN
i think it’s a herdazian thing END_TOKEN
shallan hadn’t realized how hungry she was END_TOKEN
she’d been intending to get something at one of the taverns later tonight while prowling about wearing veil’s face END_TOKEN
those taverns had set up in the main market , despite navani’s attempts to send them elsewhere , and sebarial’s merchants had quite the stock to sell END_TOKEN
now that this was all before her… well , she didn’t worry much about decorum as she settled down on the ground and started to spoon herself up a thin , watery curry with vegetables END_TOKEN
he did look sharp in that blue uniform ,
though admittedly she’d never really seen him in anything else END_TOKEN
birthmark on the thigh , eh…
you’ll have to sit on the ground , shallan said END_TOKEN
i just realized , he said , this is your bedroom END_TOKEN
and my drawing room , and my sitting room , and my dining room , and my ‘adolin says obvious things’ room END_TOKEN
it’s quite versatile , this room— singular—of mine END_TOKEN
i’m just wondering if it’s proper , he said , then actually blushed— which was adorable END_TOKEN
for us to be in here alone END_TOKEN
well , i did recently get lectured about it END_TOKEN
that wasn’t a lecture , shallan said , taking a bite of food END_TOKEN
the succulent tastes overwhelmed her mouth , bringing on that delightful sharp pain and mixing of flavor that you only got from the first bite of something sweet END_TOKEN
she closed her eyes and smiled , savoring it END_TOKEN
was there to be more to that quip END_TOKEN
sorry , she said , opening her eyes END_TOKEN
it wasn’t a lecture , it was a creative application of my tongue to keep you distracted END_TOKEN
looking at his lips , she could think of some other creative applications for her tongue END_TOKEN
it would be inappropriate , shallan said , if we were alone END_TOKEN
your ego doesn’t count as a separate individual , shallan END_TOKEN
you think i have an ego END_TOKEN
it just sounded good—i don’t mean… not that… why are you grinning END_TOKEN
sorry , shallan said , making two fists before herself and shivering in glee END_TOKEN
she’d spent so long feeling timid , it was so satisfying to hear a reference to her confidence END_TOKEN
jasnah’s teaching about practicing and acting like she was in control END_TOKEN
well , except for that whole part about having to admit to herself that she’d killed her mother END_TOKEN
as soon as she thought of it , she instinctively tried to shove the memory away , but it wouldn’t budge END_TOKEN
she’d spoken it to pattern as a truth—which were the odd ideals of the lightweavers END_TOKEN
it was stuck in her mind , and every time she thought about it , the gaping wound flared up with pain again END_TOKEN
her father had covered it up , pretended he’d murdered his wife , and the event had destroyed his life—driving him to anger and destruction END_TOKEN
until eventually shallan had killed him too END_TOKEN
she held out her hand , palm up END_TOKEN
he reluctantly moved down from the wall where he’d been watching END_TOKEN
as always , he made a ripple in whatever he crossed , be it cloth or stone—like there was something under the surface END_TOKEN
his complex , fluctuating pattern of lines was always changing , melding , vaguely circular but with surprising tangents END_TOKEN
he crossed up her dress and onto her hand , then split out from beneath her skin and rose into the air , expanding fully into three dimensions END_TOKEN
he hovered there , a black , eye - bending network of shifting lines—some patterns shrinking while others expanded , rippling across his surface like a field of moving grass END_TOKEN
she could hate the sword she’d used to kill her mother , but not him END_TOKEN
she managed to push aside the pain for now—not forgetting it , but hopefully not letting it spoil her time with adolin END_TOKEN
prince adolin , shallan said , i believe you’ve heard my spren’s voice before END_TOKEN
adolin knelt , reverent , and stared at the mesmerizing geometries END_TOKEN
shallan didn’t blame him ; she’d lost herself more than once in that network of lines and shapes that almost seemed to repeat , but never quite did END_TOKEN
pattern sniffed in annoyance at that END_TOKEN
he’s called a cryptic , she said END_TOKEN
every order of radiant bonds a different variety of spren , and that bond lets me do what i do END_TOKEN
craft illusions , adolin said softly END_TOKEN
like that one with the map the other day END_TOKEN
shallan smiled and—realizing she had just a smidge of stormlight left from her illusion earlier—was unable to resist showing off END_TOKEN
she raised her sleeved safehand and breathed out , sending a shimmering patch of stormlight above the blue cloth END_TOKEN
it formed into a small image of adolin from her sketches of him in his shardplate END_TOKEN
this one remained frozen , shardblade on his shoulder , faceplate up—like a little doll END_TOKEN
this is an incredible talent , shallan , adolin said , poking at the version of himself—which fuzzed , offering no resistance END_TOKEN
he paused , then poked at pattern , who shied back END_TOKEN
why do you insist on hiding this , pretending that you’re a different order than you are END_TOKEN
well , she said , thinking fast and closing her hand , dismissing the image of adolin END_TOKEN
i just think it might give us an edge END_TOKEN
pattern , you’re to be our chaperone tonight END_TOKEN
what , pattern said with a hum , is a chaperone END_TOKEN
that is someone who watches two young people when they are together , to make certain they don’t do anything inappropriate END_TOKEN
shallan asked , looking to adolin , who shrugged END_TOKEN
look , just keep an eye on us END_TOKEN
pattern hummed , melting down into his two - dimensional form and taking up residence on the side of a bowl END_TOKEN
he seemed content there , like a cremling snuggled into its crack END_TOKEN
unable to wait any longer , shallan dug into her meal END_TOKEN
adolin settled down across from her and attacked his own food END_TOKEN
for a time , shallan ignored her pain and savored the moment—good food , good company , the setting sun casting ruby and topaz light across the mountains and into the room END_TOKEN
she felt like drawing this scene , but knew it was the type of moment she couldn’t capture on a page END_TOKEN
it wasn’t about content or composition , but the pleasure of living END_TOKEN
the trick to happiness wasn’t in freezing every momentary pleasure and clinging to each one , but in ensuring one’s life would produce many future moments to anticipate END_TOKEN
adolin—after finishing an entire plate of stranna haspers steamed in the shell—picked out a few chunks of pork from a creamy red curry , then put them on a plate and handed them in her direction END_TOKEN
come on , he said , wagging the plate END_TOKEN
it would burn my lips off , adolin kholin , shallan said END_TOKEN
don’t think i didn’t notice you picking the absolute spiciest concoction palona sent END_TOKEN
how can you taste anything beneath all that spice END_TOKEN
keeps it from being bland , adolin said , stabbing one of the chunks and popping it in his mouth END_TOKEN
she eyed it , remembering the times as a child when she’d sneaked tastes of men’s food—though not this specific dish END_TOKEN
is this the inappropriate thing i’m supposed to stop you from doing END_TOKEN
no , shallan said , and pattern settled back down END_TOKEN
perhaps a chaperone , she thought , who believes basically everything i tell him isn’t going to be the most effective END_TOKEN
still , with a sigh , she grabbed a chunk of the pork in some flatbread END_TOKEN
she had left jah keved hunting new experiences , after all END_TOKEN
she tried a bite , and was given immediate reason to regret her decisions in life END_TOKEN
eyes brimming with tears , she scrambled for the cup of water adolin , insufferably , had picked up to hand toward her END_TOKEN
she gulped that down , though it didn’t seem to do anything END_TOKEN
she followed it by wiping her tongue with a napkin—in the most feminine way possible , of course END_TOKEN
i hate you , she said , drinking his water next END_TOKEN
pattern said suddenly , bursting up from the bowl to hover in the air END_TOKEN
i’m to make sure you don’t accidentally mate , as mating is forbidden by human society until you have first performed appropriate rituals END_TOKEN
dictates of custom require following certain patterns before you copulate END_TOKEN
oh , stormfather , shallan said , covering her eyes with her freehand END_TOKEN
a few shamespren even peeked in for a glimpse before vanishing END_TOKEN
very well , you two , pattern said END_TOKEN
he hummed to himself , as if pleased , then sank down onto a plate END_TOKEN
well , that was humiliating , shallan said END_TOKEN
can we maybe talk about those books you brought END_TOKEN
or ancient vorin theology , or strategies for counting grains of sand END_TOKEN
anything other than what just happened END_TOKEN
adolin chuckled , then reached for a slim notebook that was on top of the pile END_TOKEN
may aladar sent teams to question vedekar perel’s family and friends END_TOKEN
they discovered where he was before he died , who last saw him , and wrote down anything suspicious END_TOKEN
i thought we could read the report END_TOKEN
and the rest of the books END_TOKEN
you seemed lost when father asked you about makabaki politics , adolin said , pouring some wine , merely a soft yellow END_TOKEN
so i asked around , and it seems that some of the ardents hauled their entire libraries out here END_TOKEN
i was able to get a servant to locate you a few books i’d enjoyed on the makabaki END_TOKEN
i don’t spend all my time hitting people with swords , shallan , adolin said END_TOKEN
jasnah and aunt navani made very certain that my youth was filled with interminable periods spent listening to ardents lecture me on politics and trade END_TOKEN
some of it stuck in my brain , against my natural inclinations END_TOKEN
those three books are the best of the ones i remember having read to me , though the last one is an updated version END_TOKEN
i figured , you know , if we’re going to move forward with the betrothal…
some kind of half - divine being from mythology END_TOKEN
and all along i was thinking we were giving you a favorable match END_TOKEN
he stood up and started pacing END_TOKEN
i didn’t mean to say it like that END_TOKEN
i just… i keep worrying that i’m going to screw this up somehow END_TOKEN
you worry you’re going to screw it up END_TOKEN
shallan said , feeling a warmth inside that wasn’t completely due to the wine END_TOKEN
i’m not good with relationships , shallan END_TOKEN
is there anyone who actually is END_TOKEN
i mean , is there really someone out there who looks at relationships and thinks , ‘you know what , i’ve got this’ END_TOKEN
personally , i rather think we’re all collectively idiots about it END_TOKEN
adolin , dear , the last man i had a romantic interest in was not only an ardent—forbidden to court me in the first place—but also turned out to be an assassin who was merely trying to obtain my favor so he could get close to jasnah END_TOKEN
i think you overestimate everyone else’s capability in this regard END_TOKEN
he almost killed me with a loaf of poisoned bread END_TOKEN
i have to hear this story END_TOKEN
fortunately , i just told it to you END_TOKEN
his name was kabsal , and he was so incredibly sweet to me that i can almost forgive him for trying to kill me END_TOKEN
well , it’s nice to hear that i don’t have a high bar to jump—all i have to do is not poison you END_TOKEN
though you shouldn’t be telling me about past lovers END_TOKEN
please , shallan said , dipping her bread in some leftover sweet curry END_TOKEN
you’ve courted , like , half the warcamps END_TOKEN
from what i hear , i’d have to go to herdaz to find an eligible woman you haven’t pursued END_TOKEN
she held out her hand to him , to help her to her feet END_TOKEN
no , i’m lauding them , she said , standing up beside him END_TOKEN
you see , adolin dear , if you hadn’t wrecked all those other relationships , you wouldn’t be here END_TOKEN
and so , in reality , you’re the greatest at relationships there ever was END_TOKEN
you ruined only the wrong ones , you see END_TOKEN
his breath smelled of spices , his uniform of the crisp , clean starch dalinar required END_TOKEN
his lips touched hers , and her heart fluttered END_TOKEN
she started , pulling out of the kiss to find pattern hovering beside them , pulsing quickly through shapes END_TOKEN
adolin bellowed a laugh , and shallan couldn’t help joining in at the ridiculousness of it END_TOKEN
she stepped back from him , but kept hold on his hand END_TOKEN
neither of us is going to mess this up , she said to him , squeezing his hand END_TOKEN
despite what might at times seem like our best efforts otherwise END_TOKEN
let’s look at this notebook of yours and see what it says about our murderer END_TOKEN
in this record , i hold nothing back END_TOKEN
i will try not to shy away from difficult topics , or paint myself in a dishonestly heroic light END_TOKEN
kaladin crept through the rains , sidling in a wet uniform across the rocks until he was able to peek through the trees at the voidbringers END_TOKEN
monstrous terrors from the mythological past , enemies of all that was right and good END_TOKEN
destroyers who had laid waste to civilization countless times END_TOKEN
the voidbringers had posted a single guard , but the creature had simply been sitting on a tree stump , easy to avoid END_TOKEN
a decoy , kaladin had assumed , figuring he would find the true guard watching from the heights of the trees END_TOKEN
if there was a hidden guard though , kaladin had missed spotting them— and they’d missed kaladin in equal measure END_TOKEN
the dim light served him well , as he was able to settle between some bushes right at the edge of the voidbringer camp END_TOKEN
between trees they had stretched tarps , which leaked horribly END_TOKEN
in one place they’d made a proper tent , fully enclosed with walls— and he couldn’t see what was inside END_TOKEN
there wasn’t enough shelter , so many sat out in the rain END_TOKEN
kaladin spent a torturous few minutes expecting to be spotted END_TOKEN
all they had to do was notice that these bushes had drawn in their leaves at his touch END_TOKEN
the leaves timidly peeked back out , obscuring him END_TOKEN
syl landed on his arm , hands on her hips as she surveyed the voidbringers END_TOKEN
one of them had a set of wooden herdazian cards , and he sat at the edge of the camp—directly before kaladin—using a flat surface of stone as a table END_TOKEN
they looked different from what he expected END_TOKEN
for one thing , their skin was a diff rent shade—many parshmen here in alethkar had marbled white and red skin , rather than the deep red on black like rlain from bridge four END_TOKEN
they didn’t wear warform , though neither did they wear some terrible , powerful form END_TOKEN
though they were squat and bulky , their only carapace ran along the sides of their forearms and jutted out at their temples , leaving them with full heads of hair END_TOKEN
they still wore their simple slave smocks , tied at the waists with strings END_TOKEN
did that change , perhaps , like his own eyes END_TOKEN
the male—distinguished by a dark red beard , the hairs each unnaturally thick—finally placed a card on the rock next to several others END_TOKEN
unless another card of mine is touching yours , the male said END_TOKEN
kaladin felt cold , like the rainwater was seeping in through his skin , penetrating all the way to his blood and washing through him END_TOKEN
not a hint of an accent END_TOKEN
with his eyes closed , he wouldn’t have been able to tell these voices from those of common darkeyed villagers from hearthstone , save for the fact that the female had a deeper voice than most human women END_TOKEN
you’re saying you don’t know how to play the game after all END_TOKEN
the male began gathering up the cards END_TOKEN
how many times did i watch them play END_TOKEN
standing there with my tray of drinks END_TOKEN
i should be an expert at this , shouldn’t i END_TOKEN
the female stood and walked over to another group , who were trying to build a fire under a tarp without much success END_TOKEN
it took a special kind of luck to be able to get flames going outside during the weeping END_TOKEN
kaladin , like most in the military , had learned to live with the constant dampness END_TOKEN
they had the stolen sacks of grain—kaladin could see them piled underneath one of the tarps END_TOKEN
the grain had swollen , splitting several of the sacks END_TOKEN
several were eating soggy handfuls , since they had no bowls END_TOKEN
kaladin wished he didn’t immediately taste the mushy , awful stuff in his own mouth END_TOKEN
he’d been given unspiced , boiled tallew on many occasions END_TOKEN
often he’d considered it a blessing END_TOKEN
the male who’d been speaking continued to sit on his rock , holding up a wooden card END_TOKEN
they were a lacquered set , durable END_TOKEN
kaladin had occasionally seen their like in the military END_TOKEN
men would save for months to get a set like this , that wouldn’t warp in the rain END_TOKEN
the parshman looked so forlorn , staring down at his card , shoulders slumped END_TOKEN
this is wrong , kaladin whispered to syl END_TOKEN
what had happened to the beasts with the red eyes that had tried to crush dalinar’s army END_TOKEN
the terrible , haunting figures that bridge four had described to him END_TOKEN
we thought we understood what was going to happen , kaladin thought END_TOKEN
a sudden , shrill voice called END_TOKEN
something zipped through the air , a glowing yellow ribbon , a streak of light in the dim afternoon shade END_TOKEN
he’s there , the shrill voice said END_TOKEN
kaladin burst up through the underbrush , ready to suck in stormlight and be away END_TOKEN
though fewer towns had any now , as it was running out again , he had a little left END_TOKEN
the parshmen seized cudgels made from branches or the handles of brooms END_TOKEN
they bunched together and held the sticks like frightened villagers , no stance , no control END_TOKEN
i could take them all in a fight even without stormlight END_TOKEN
he’d seen men hold weapons like that many times before END_TOKEN
most recently , he’d seen it inside the chasms , when training the bridgemen END_TOKEN
syl flitted up to him , prepared to become a blade END_TOKEN
no , kaladin whispered to her END_TOKEN
then he held his hands to the sides , speaking more loudly END_TOKEN
i will express only direct , even brutal , truth END_TOKEN
you must know what i have done , and what those actions cost me END_TOKEN
brightlord perel’s body was found in the same area as sadeas’s , shallan said , pacing back and forth in her room as she flipped through pages of the report END_TOKEN
this tower is far too big END_TOKEN
so we know where the murderer is prowling END_TOKEN
yeah , i suppose , adolin said END_TOKEN
he lounged with his back against the wall , coat unbuttoned while tossing a small leather ball filled with dried grain into the air and catching it again END_TOKEN
i just think the murders could have been done by two different people END_TOKEN
same exact method of murder , shallan said END_TOKEN
nothing else connecting them , adolin said END_TOKEN
sadeas was slime , widely hated , and usually accompanied by guards END_TOKEN
perel was quiet , well - liked , and known for his administrative prowess END_TOKEN
he was less a soldier than a manager END_TOKEN
the sun had fully set by now , and they’d set out spheres on the floor for light END_TOKEN
the remnants of their meal had been carted away by a servant , and pattern hummed happily on the wall near adolin’s head END_TOKEN
adolin glanced at him occasionally , looking uncomfortable , which she fully understood END_TOKEN
she’d grown used to pattern , but his lines were strange END_TOKEN
wait until adolin sees a cryptic in shadesmar form , she thought , with a full body but twisting shapes for his head END_TOKEN
adolin tossed the little stitched ball into the air and caught it with his right hand—the one that renarin , amazingly , had healed END_TOKEN
she wasn’t the only one practicing with her powers END_TOKEN
she was especially glad someone else had a shardblade now END_TOKEN
when the highstorms returned , and they began working the oathgate in earnest , she’d have help END_TOKEN
these reports , shallan said , tapping the notebook against her hand , are both informative and useless END_TOKEN
nothing connects perel and sadeas save their both being lighteyes—that and the part of the tower they were in END_TOKEN
perhaps mere opportunity drove the killer’s choice of victims END_TOKEN
you’re saying someone happened to kill a highprince , adolin said , by accident END_TOKEN
like… a back - alley murder outside a pub END_TOKEN
brightness aladar suggests in here that your father lay down some rules on people moving alone through empty parts of the tower END_TOKEN
i still think there might be two murderers , adolin said END_TOKEN
you know… like someone saw sadeas dead , and figured they could get away with killing someone else , blaming it on the first fellow END_TOKEN
oh , adolin , shallan thought END_TOKEN
he’d arrived at a theory he liked , and now wouldn’t let it go END_TOKEN
it was a common mistake warned of in her scientific books END_TOKEN
adolin did have one point—a highprince being murdered was unlikely to be random chance END_TOKEN
there were no signs of sadeas’s shardblade , oathbringer , being used by anyone , not even a rumor of it END_TOKEN
maybe the second death is a kind of decoy END_TOKEN
shallan thought , riffling through the report again END_TOKEN
an attempt to make it seem like random attacks END_TOKEN
no , that was too convoluted—and she had no more evidence for it than adolin had for his theory END_TOKEN
maybe everyone was paying attention to these two deaths because they’d happened to important lighteyes END_TOKEN
could there be other deaths they hadn’t noticed because they’d happened to less prominent individuals END_TOKEN
if a beggar had been found in adolin’s proverbial back alley behind a pub , would anyone have remarked upon it—even if he’d been stabbed through the eye END_TOKEN
i need to get out there among them and see what i can find END_TOKEN
she opened her mouth to tell him she should probably turn in , but he was already standing , stretching END_TOKEN
i think we’ve done what we can with that , he said , nodding toward the report END_TOKEN
yeah , shallan said , feigning a yawn END_TOKEN
so… adolin said , then took a deep breath END_TOKEN
why did he suddenly look like he was preparing to do something difficult END_TOKEN
he’s going to break off our betrothal END_TOKEN
a part of her mind thought , though she pounced on that emotion and shoved it back behind the curtains where it belonged END_TOKEN
okay , this isn’t easy , adolin said END_TOKEN
i don’t want to offend , shallan END_TOKEN
but… you know how i had you eat that man’s food END_TOKEN
if my tongue is particularly spicy in the coming days , i blame you END_TOKEN
shallan , there’s something similar that we need to talk about END_TOKEN
something about you we can’t just ignore END_TOKEN
i stabbed my mother through the chest and i strangled my father while singing to him END_TOKEN
you , adolin said , have a shardblade END_TOKEN
i didn’t want to kill her END_TOKEN
adolin grabbed her by the shoulders and she started , focusing on him END_TOKEN
you have a shardblade , shallan END_TOKEN
i dreamed for years of earning my blade END_TOKEN
so many men spend their lives with that very dream and never see it fulfilled END_TOKEN
and that’s a good thing , right END_TOKEN
she said , held in his grip with arms pulled tight against her body END_TOKEN
adolin said , letting go of her END_TOKEN
but , i mean , you’re a woman END_TOKEN
was it the makeup that tipped you off , or the dress END_TOKEN
oh , it was the breasts , wasn’t it END_TOKEN
i know , she said , calming her nerves END_TOKEN
yes , pattern can become a shardblade , adolin END_TOKEN
i don’t see what this has to do with anything END_TOKEN
you want to teach me how to use it , don’t you END_TOKEN
you said that jasnah was a radiant too END_TOKEN
it’s weird , but it’s not like we can ignore it END_TOKEN
do you have that hidden somewhere too END_TOKEN
not that i know of , she said END_TOKEN
her heart was beating quickly , her skin growing cold , her muscles tense END_TOKEN
i don’t know where plate comes from END_TOKEN
i know it’s not feminine , but who cares END_TOKEN
you’ve got a sword ; you should know how to use it , and custom can go to damnation END_TOKEN
i mean , the bridgeboy can have one , and he’s darkeyed END_TOKEN
anyway , it’s not so different from that END_TOKEN
thank you , shallan thought , for ranking all women as something equivalent to peasants END_TOKEN
this was obviously an important moment for adolin , and he was trying to be broad - minded END_TOKEN
but… thinking of what she’d done pained her END_TOKEN
holding the weapon would be worse END_TOKEN
this truth refused to budge from her mind END_TOKEN
so , you’re right , but—
i brought the blade guards so we won’t hurt each other END_TOKEN
i stashed them back at the guard post END_TOKEN
he was out the door a moment later END_TOKEN
shallan stood with her hand stretched toward him , objections dying on her lips END_TOKEN
she curled her fingers up and brought her hand to her breast , her heart thundering within END_TOKEN
shallan scrambled through the room to the small mirror she’d hung from the wall END_TOKEN
she stared at herself , eyes wide , hair an utter mess END_TOKEN
she’d started breathing in sharp , quick gasps END_TOKEN
i can’t be this person , pattern END_TOKEN
i can’t just wield the sword END_TOKEN
some brilliant knight on a tower , pretending she should be followed END_TOKEN
pattern hummed softly a tone she’d come to recognize as confusion END_TOKEN
the bewilderment of one species trying to comprehend the mind of another END_TOKEN
sweat trickled down shallan’s face , running beside her eye as she stared at herself END_TOKEN
what did she expect to see END_TOKEN
the thought of breaking down in front of adolin heightened her tension END_TOKEN
her every muscle grew taut , and the corners of her vision started to darken END_TOKEN
she could see only before herself , and she wanted to run , go somewhere END_TOKEN
no , just be someone else END_TOKEN
hands shaking , she scrambled over and dug out her drawing pad END_TOKEN
she ripped pages , flinging them out of the way to reach an empty one , then seized her charcoal pencil END_TOKEN
pattern moved over to her , a floating ball of shifting lines , buzzing in concern END_TOKEN
i can hide , shallan thought , drawing at a frenzied pace END_TOKEN
shallan can flee and leave someone in her place END_TOKEN
it’s because you hate me , pattern said softly END_TOKEN
they will send you another to bond END_TOKEN
a high - pitched whine started to rise in the room , one shallan didn’t immediately recognize as coming from the back of her own throat END_TOKEN
pattern’s words were like knives to her side END_TOKEN
veil would be fine holding a sword END_TOKEN
she didn’t have shallan’s broken soul , and hadn’t killed her parents END_TOKEN
she’d be able to do this END_TOKEN
no , what would adolin do if he returned and found a completely different woman in the room END_TOKEN
the lines she sketched , ragged and unrefined from the shaking pencil , quickly took the shape of her own face END_TOKEN
a poised woman , not as flighty as shallan , not as unintentionally silly END_TOKEN
a woman who hadn’t been sheltered END_TOKEN
a woman hard enough , strong enough , to wield this sword END_TOKEN
yes , jasnah’s subtle smile , composure , and self - confidence END_TOKEN
shallan outlined her own face with these ideals , creating a harder version of it END_TOKEN
could… could she be this woman END_TOKEN
i have to be , shallan thought , drawing in stormlight from her satchel , then breathing it out in a puff around her END_TOKEN
she stood up as the change took hold END_TOKEN
her heartbeat slowed , and she wiped the sweat from her brow , then calmly undid her safehand sleeve , tossed aside the foolish extra pouch she’d tied around her hand inside , then rolled the sleeve back to expose her still - gloved hand END_TOKEN
adolin couldn’t possibly expect her to put on sparring clothing END_TOKEN
she pulled her hair back into a bun and fixed it in place with hairspikes from her satchel END_TOKEN
when adolin returned to the room a moment later , he found a poised , calm woman who wasn’t quite shallan davar END_TOKEN
brightness radiant is her name , she thought END_TOKEN
she will go only by title END_TOKEN
adolin carried two long , thin pieces of metal that somehow could meld to the front of shardblades and make them less dangerous for use in sparring END_TOKEN
radiant inspected them with a critical eye , then held her hand to the side , summoning pattern END_TOKEN
the blade formed—a long , thin weapon nearly as tall as she was END_TOKEN
pattern , she said , can modulate his shape , and will dull his edge to safe levels END_TOKEN
i shan’t need such a clunky device END_TOKEN
indeed , pattern’s edge rippled , dulling END_TOKEN
adolin summoned his own blade , a process that took him ten heartbeats—during which he turned his head , looking at her END_TOKEN
shallan glanced down , realizing that she’d enhanced her bust in this guise END_TOKEN
not for him , of course END_TOKEN
she’d just been making herself look more like jasnah END_TOKEN
adolin’s sword finally appeared , with a thicker blade than her own , sinuous along the sharp edge , with delicate crystalline ridges along the back END_TOKEN
he put one of the guards on the sword’s edge END_TOKEN
radiant put one foot forward , blade lifted high in two hands beside her head END_TOKEN
shallan did spend quite a lot of time drawing you all END_TOKEN
he approached and reached toward her with a thumb and two fingers END_TOKEN
she thought he was going to adjust her grip , but instead he pressed his fingers against her collarbone and shoved lightly END_TOKEN
radiant stumbled backward , almost tripping END_TOKEN
a stance , adolin said , is about more than just looking great on the battlefield END_TOKEN
it’s about footing , center of balance , and control of the fight END_TOKEN
so how do i make it better END_TOKEN
everyone i’ve worked with before had been using a sword since their youth END_TOKEN
i’m wondering how zahel would have changed my training if i’d never even picked up a weapon END_TOKEN
from what i’ve heard of him , radiant said , it will depend on where there are any convenient rooftops nearby to jump off END_TOKEN
that’s how he trained with plate , adolin said END_TOKEN
or should i teach you how to fight in an army END_TOKEN
i shall settle , radiant said , for knowing how to avoid cutting off any of my own appendages , brightlord kholin END_TOKEN
that was how radiant would act , of course—but she could allow herself some familiarity END_TOKEN
i was merely , radiant said , attempting to show the respect due a master from his humble pupil END_TOKEN
but here , let’s see what we can do about that stance END_TOKEN
over the next hour , adolin positioned her hands , her feet , and her arms a dozen times over END_TOKEN
he picked a basic stance for her that she could eventually adapt into several of the formal stances—the ones like windstance , which adolin said wouldn’t rely on strength or reach as much as mobility and skill END_TOKEN
she wasn’t certain why he’d bothered fetching the metal sparring sleeves , as the two of them didn’t exchange any blows END_TOKEN
other than correcting her stance ten thousand times , he spoke about the art of the duel END_TOKEN
how to treat your shardblade , how to think of an opponent , how to show respect to the institutions and traditions of the duel itself END_TOKEN
some of it was very practical END_TOKEN
shardblades were dangerous weapons , which explained the demonstrations on how to hold hers , how to walk with it , how to take care not to slice people or things while casually turning END_TOKEN
other parts of his monologue were more… mystical END_TOKEN
the blade is part of you , adolin said END_TOKEN
the blade is more than your tool ; it is your life END_TOKEN
it will not fail you—if you are bested , it is because you failed the sword END_TOKEN
radiant stood in what felt like a very stiff pose , blade held before herself in two hands END_TOKEN
she’d only scraped pattern on the ceiling two or three times ; fortunately , most of the rooms in urithiru had high ceilings END_TOKEN
adolin gestured for her to perform a simple strike , as they’d been practicing END_TOKEN
radiant raised both arms , tilting the sword , then took a step forward while bringing it down END_TOKEN
the entire angle of movement couldn’t have been more than ninety degrees—barely a strike at all END_TOKEN
a few thousand more of those , and it will start to feel natural END_TOKEN
we’ll have to work on your breathing though END_TOKEN
adolin , radiant said , i assure you , i have been breathing—without fail—my entire life END_TOKEN
that’s why you’re going to have to unlearn it END_TOKEN
how i stand , how i think , how i breathe END_TOKEN
i have trouble distinguishing what is actually relevant , and what is part of the subculture and superstition of swordsmen END_TOKEN
it’s all relevant , adolin said END_TOKEN
well , maybe some things are personal quirks END_TOKEN
but the swords are part of us END_TOKEN
i know mine is part of me , radiant said , resting the blade at her side and setting her gloved safehand on it END_TOKEN
i suspect this is the origin of the tradition among shardbearers END_TOKEN
so academic , adolin said , shaking his head END_TOKEN
you need to feel this , shallan END_TOKEN
that would not have been a difficult task for shallan END_TOKEN
radiant , however , preferred not to feel things she hadn’t considered in depth beforehand END_TOKEN
have you considered , she said , that your shardblade was once a living spren , wielded by one of the knights radiant END_TOKEN
doesn’t that change how you look at it END_TOKEN
adolin glanced toward his blade , which he’d left summoned , strapped with the sheath and set across her blankets END_TOKEN
i mean… i’ve always known there was something special about them END_TOKEN
it’s part of being a duelist , i think END_TOKEN
swordsmen , from what she’d seen , were superstitious END_TOKEN
as were… well , basically everyone but scholars like radiant and jasnah END_TOKEN
it was curious to her how much of adolin’s rhetoric about blades and dueling reminded her of religion END_TOKEN
how strange that these alethi often treated their actual religion so flippantly END_TOKEN
in jah keved , shallan had spent hours painting lengthy passages from the arguments END_TOKEN
you’d speak the words out loud over and over , committing them to memory while kneeling or bowing , before finally burning the paper END_TOKEN
the alethi instead preferred to let the ardents deal with the almighty , like he was some annoying parlor guest who could be safely distracted by servants offering a particularly tasty tea END_TOKEN
adolin let her do some more strikes , perhaps sensing that she was growing tired of having her stance constantly adjusted END_TOKEN
as she was swinging , he grabbed his own blade and fell in beside her , modeling the stance and the strikes END_TOKEN
after a short time of that she dismissed her blade , then picked up her sketchbook END_TOKEN
she quickly flipped past the drawing of radiant , and started to sketch adolin in his stance END_TOKEN
she was forced to let some of radiant bleed away END_TOKEN
no , stand there , shallan said , pointing at adolin with her charcoal END_TOKEN
she sketched out the stance , then nodded END_TOKEN
now strike , and hold the last position END_TOKEN
by now he’d removed his jacket , standing in only shirt and trousers END_TOKEN
she did like how that tight shirt fit him END_TOKEN
she wasn’t dead , just pragmatic END_TOKEN
she looked over the two sketches , then resummoned pattern and fell into position END_TOKEN
hey , nice , adolin said as radiant performed the next few strikes END_TOKEN
he again fell in beside her END_TOKEN
the simple attack he’d taught her was obviously a poor test of his skills , but he executed it with precision nonetheless , then grinned and started talking about the first few lessons he’d had with zahel long ago END_TOKEN
his blue eyes were alight , and shallan loved seeing that glow from him END_TOKEN
she knew that passion—she’d felt what it was to be alive with interest , to be consumed by something so fully that you lost yourself in the wonder of it END_TOKEN
for her it was art , but watching him , she thought that the two of them weren’t so different END_TOKEN
sharing these moments with him and drinking of his excitement felt special END_TOKEN
even more so than their closeness had been earlier in the evening END_TOKEN
she let herself be shallan in some of the moments , but whenever the pain of holding the sword started to spike—whenever she really thought about what she was doing—she was able to become radiant and avoid it END_TOKEN
she was genuinely reluctant to see the time end , so she let it stretch into the late evening , well past when she should have called a halt END_TOKEN
at long last , shallan bade a tired , sweaty farewell to adolin and watched him trot down the strata - lined hallway outside , a spring to his step , a lamp in his hands , blade guards held on his shoulder END_TOKEN
shallan would have to wait another night to visit taverns and hunt for answers END_TOKEN
she trailed back into her room—strangely contented for all that the world might be in the middle of ending END_TOKEN
that night she slept , for once , in peace END_TOKEN
for in this comes the lesson END_TOKEN
a legend rested on the stone slab before dalinar END_TOKEN
a weapon pulled from the ancient mists of time , and said to have been forged during the shadowdays by the hand of god himself END_TOKEN
the blade of the assassin in white , claimed by kaladin stormblessed during their clash above the storm END_TOKEN
upon cursory inspection , it was indistinguishable from an ordinary shardblade END_TOKEN
elegant , relatively small—in that it was barely five feet long— it was thin and curved like a tusk END_TOKEN
it had patterns only at the base of the blade near the hilt END_TOKEN
he’d lit it with four diamond broams , placed at the corners of the altar - like stone slab END_TOKEN
this small room had no strata or paintings on the walls , so the stormlight lit only him and that alien blade END_TOKEN
gemstones were what allowed men to bond to shardblades END_TOKEN
often affixed at the pommel , though occasionally at the spot where hilt met blade , the gem would flash when you first touched it , initiating the process END_TOKEN
keep the blade with you for a week , and the blade became yours—dismissible and returnable in time with your heartbeat END_TOKEN
dalinar hesitantly reached out and rested his fingers on its silvery length END_TOKEN
it was warm to the touch , like something alive END_TOKEN
it doesn’t scream when i touch it , he noted END_TOKEN
the knights , the stormfather said in his head , broke their oaths END_TOKEN
they abandoned everything they’d sworn , and in so doing killed their spren END_TOKEN
other blades are the corpses of those spren , which is why they scream at your touch END_TOKEN
this weapon , instead , was made directly from honor’s soul , then given to the heralds END_TOKEN
it is also the mark of an oath , but a different type—and does not have the mind to scream on its own END_TOKEN
related , but different , the stormfather rumbled END_TOKEN
you haven’t spoken the oaths required to know more END_TOKEN
you cannot break oaths , dalinar said , fingers still resting on the honorblade END_TOKEN
what of the thing we fight END_TOKEN
odium , the origin of the voidbringers and their spren END_TOKEN
he is far greater than i , but the power of ancient adonalsium permeates him END_TOKEN
odium is a force like pressure , gravitation , or the movement of time END_TOKEN
these things cannot break their own rules END_TOKEN
a fragment of honor’s own soul , crystalized into metallic form END_TOKEN
in a way , the death of their god gave him hope—for if honor had fallen , surely odium could as well END_TOKEN
in visions , honor had left dalinar with a task END_TOKEN
vex odium , convince him that he can lose , and appoint a champion END_TOKEN
he will take that chance instead of risking defeat again , as he has suffered so often END_TOKEN
this is the best advice i can give you END_TOKEN
i’ve seen that the enemy is preparing a champion , dalinar said END_TOKEN
a dark creature with red eyes and nine shadows END_TOKEN
can i make odium agree to a decisive contest between me and that champion END_TOKEN
of course honor’s suggestion would work , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
i mean , dalinar said , why would it work END_TOKEN
why would this odium ever agree to a contest of champions END_TOKEN
it seems too momentous a matter to risk on something so small and inferior as the prowess and will of men END_TOKEN
your enemy is not a man like you , the stormfather replied , voice rumbling , thoughtful END_TOKEN
but this does not change , and his rage does not cool END_TOKEN
epochs can pass , and he will remain the same END_TOKEN
to fight directly might coax out forces that could hurt him , as he has been hurt before END_TOKEN
to pick a champion , then lose , will only cost him time END_TOKEN
he still will not agree easily , but it is possible he will agree END_TOKEN
if presented with the option in the right moment , the right way END_TOKEN
which , though dross to him , is the most valuable thing a man can have END_TOKEN
dalinar slipped the honorblade off the slab END_TOKEN
at the side of the room , a shaft cut into the ground END_TOKEN
two feet wide , it was one of many strange holes , corridors , and hidden corners they’d found in the tower city END_TOKEN
this one was probably part of a sewage system ; judging by the rust on the edges of the hole , there had once been a metal pipe here connecting the stone hole in the floor to one in the ceiling END_TOKEN
one of navani’s primary concerns was figuring out how all this worked END_TOKEN
for now , they’d gotten by using wooden frames to turn certain large , communal rooms with ancient baths into privies END_TOKEN
once they had more stormlight , their soulcasters could deal with the waste , as they’d done in the warcamps END_TOKEN
communal privies with sometimes long lines made for an inefficient city , and she claimed that these tubes indicated a widespread piping and sanitation system END_TOKEN
it was exactly the sort of large - scale civic project that engaged her—he’d never known anyone to get as excited by sewage as navani kholin END_TOKEN
for now , this tube was empty END_TOKEN
dalinar knelt and lowered the sword into the hole , sliding it into a stone sheath he’d cut in the side END_TOKEN
the upper lip of the hole shielded the protruding hilt from sight ; you’d have to reach down and feel in the hole to find the honorblade END_TOKEN
he stood up , then gathered his spheres and made his way out END_TOKEN
he hated leaving it there , but he could think of nothing safer END_TOKEN
his rooms didn’t feel secure enough yet—he had no vault , and a crowd of guards would only draw attention END_TOKEN
beyond kaladin , navani , and the stormfather himself , nobody even knew that dalinar had this END_TOKEN
if he masked his movements , there was virtually no chance of the blade being discovered in this vacant portion of the tower END_TOKEN
what will you do with it END_TOKEN
the stormfather asked as dalinar entered the empty corridors END_TOKEN
it is a weapon beyond parallel END_TOKEN
with it , you would be a windrunner unoathed END_TOKEN
more that men do not understand , and cannot END_TOKEN
all the more reason , dalinar said , to think very carefully before using it END_TOKEN
though i wouldn’t mind if you kept an eye on it for me END_TOKEN
you think i can see all things END_TOKEN
i kind of assumed… the map we made…
i see what is left out in the storms , and that darkly END_TOKEN
i am no god , dalinar kholin END_TOKEN
no more than your shadow on the wall is you END_TOKEN
dalinar reached the steps downward , then wound around and around , holding a broam for light END_TOKEN
if captain kaladin didn’t return soon , the honorblade would provide another means of windrunning—a way to get to thaylen city or azir at speed END_TOKEN
or to get elhokar’s team to kholinar END_TOKEN
the stormfather had also confirmed it could work oathgates , which might prove handy END_TOKEN
dalinar reached more inhabited sections of the tower , which bustled with movement END_TOKEN
a chef’s assistants hauling supplies from the storage dump right inside the tower gates , a couple of men painting lines on the floor to guide , families of soldiers in a particularly wide hallway , sitting on boxes along the wall and watching children roll wooden spheres down a slope into a room that had probably been another bath END_TOKEN
such an odd place to make a home , yet they’d transformed the barren shattered plains into one END_TOKEN
this tower wouldn’t be so diff rent , assuming they could keep farming operations going on the shattered plains END_TOKEN
and assuming they had enough stormlight to keep those oathgates working END_TOKEN
he was the odd man out , holding a sphere END_TOKEN
the cooks worked by lamp oil , but their stores were starting to run low END_TOKEN
the women watching children and darning socks used only the light of a few windows along the wall here END_TOKEN
today’s guards , spearmen from bridge thirteen , waited outside END_TOKEN
he waved for them to follow him END_TOKEN
one asked , catching up quickly END_TOKEN
he spoke with a slow drawl—a koron accent , from near the sunmaker mountains in central alethkar END_TOKEN
fine , dalinar said tersely , trying to determine the time END_TOKEN
how long had he spent speaking with the stormfather END_TOKEN
good , good , the guard said , spear held lightly to his shoulder END_TOKEN
wouldn’t want anything ta have happened ta you END_TOKEN
when you said nobody should be going about alone END_TOKEN
clean - shaven , he was a little pale for an alethi and had dark brown hair END_TOKEN
dalinar vaguely thought the man had shown up among his guards several times during the last week or so END_TOKEN
he liked to roll a sphere across his knuckles in what dalinar found to be a distracting way END_TOKEN
the soldier raised a hand and gave a precise salute , so careful it could have been given by one of dalinar’s finest officers , except he maintained the same lazy expression END_TOKEN
well , sergeant rial , i was not alone , dalinar said END_TOKEN
where did you get this habit of questioning officers END_TOKEN
it isn’t a habit if you only do it once , brightlord END_TOKEN
and you’ve only ever done it once END_TOKEN
well , rial said , those don’t count , brightlord END_TOKEN
well , rial , do you know what time it is END_TOKEN
i have trouble telling in these storming corridors END_TOKEN
you could use the clock device brightness navani sent you , sir , rial said END_TOKEN
i think that’s what they’re for , you know END_TOKEN
dalinar affixed him with another glare END_TOKEN
wasn’t questioning you , sir , rial said END_TOKEN
it wasn’t a question , see END_TOKEN
dalinar finally turned and stalked back down the corridor to his rooms END_TOKEN
where was that package navani had given him END_TOKEN
he found it on an end table , and from inside it removed a leather bracer somewhat like what an archer would wear END_TOKEN
it had two clock faces set into the top END_TOKEN
one showed the time with three hands—even seconds , as if that mattered END_TOKEN
the other was a stormclock , which could be set to wind down to the next projected highstorm END_TOKEN
how did they get it all so small END_TOKEN
he wondered , shaking the device END_TOKEN
set into the leather , it also had a painrial—a gemstone fabrial that would take pain from him if he pressed his hand on it END_TOKEN
navani had been working on various forms of pain - related fabrials for use by surgeons , and had mentioned using him as a test subject END_TOKEN
he strapped the device to his forearm , right above the wrist END_TOKEN
it felt conspicuous there , wrapping around the outside of his uniform sleeve , but it had been a gift END_TOKEN
in any case , he had an hour until his next scheduled meeting END_TOKEN
time to work out some of his restless energy END_TOKEN
he collected his two guards , then made his way down a level to one of the larger chambers near where he housed his soldiers END_TOKEN
the room had black and grey strata on the walls , and was filled with men training END_TOKEN
they all wore kholin blue , even if just an armband END_TOKEN
for now both lighteyes and dark practiced in the same chamber , sparring in rings with padded cloth mats END_TOKEN
as always , the sounds and smells of sparring warmed dalinar END_TOKEN
sweeter than the scent of flatbread baking was that of oiled leather END_TOKEN
more welcoming than the sound of flutes was that of practice swords rapping against one another END_TOKEN
wherever he was , and whatever station he obtained , a place like this would always be home END_TOKEN
he found the swordmasters assembled at the back wall , seated on cushions and supervising their students END_TOKEN
save for one notable exception , they all had squared beards , shaved heads , and simple , open - fronted robes that tied at the waist END_TOKEN
dalinar owned ardents who were experts in all manner of specialties , and per tradition any man or woman could come to them and be apprenticed in a new skill or trade END_TOKEN
the swordmasters , however , were his pride END_TOKEN
five of the six men rose and bowed to him END_TOKEN
dalinar turned to survey the room again END_TOKEN
the smell of sweat , the clang of weapons END_TOKEN
they were the signs of preparation END_TOKEN
the world might be in chaos , but alethkar prepared END_TOKEN
storms , it was going to be diffi ult to accustom himself to that END_TOKEN
he would always be alethi , but once elhokar’s proclamation came out , alethkar would no longer be his END_TOKEN
he still hadn’t figured out how to present that fact to his armies END_TOKEN
he wanted to give navani and her scribes time to work out the exact legalities END_TOKEN
you’ve done well here , dalinar said to kelerand , one of the swordmasters END_TOKEN
ask ivis if she’d look at expanding the training quarters into adjacent chambers END_TOKEN
i want you to keep the troops busy END_TOKEN
i’m worried about them getting restless and starting more fights END_TOKEN
it will be done , brightlord , kelerand said , bowing END_TOKEN
i’d like a spar myself , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i shall find someone suitable , brightlord END_TOKEN
the swordmaster bested dalinar two out of three times , and though dalinar had given up delusions of someday becoming the better swordsman—he was a soldier , not a duelist—he liked the challenge END_TOKEN
i will , kelerand said stiffly , of course do as my highprince commands , though if given a choice , i shall pass END_TOKEN
with all due respect , i don’t feel that i would make a suitable match for you today END_TOKEN
dalinar glanced toward the other standing swordmasters , who lowered their eyes END_TOKEN
swordmaster ardents weren’t generally like their more religious counterparts END_TOKEN
they could be formal at times , but you could laugh with them END_TOKEN
though he’d intended it only as a dismissal of kelerand , the other four joined him , leaving dalinar END_TOKEN
he sighed , leaning back against the wall , and glanced to the side END_TOKEN
one man still lounged on his cushion END_TOKEN
he wore a scruffy beard and clothing that seemed an afterthought—not dirty , but ragged , belted with rope END_TOKEN
not offended by my presence , zahel END_TOKEN
you’re no more revolting than the rest , mister highprince END_TOKEN
dalinar settled down on a stool to wait END_TOKEN
i thought… well , they’re fighting ardents END_TOKEN
you’re dangerously close to threatening them with a decision , brightlord : choose between god and their highprince END_TOKEN
the fact that they like you doesn’t make the decision easier , but more difficult END_TOKEN
their discomfort will pass , dalinar said END_TOKEN
my marriage , though it seems dramatic now , will eventually be a mere trivial note in history END_TOKEN
every moment in our lives seems trivial , zahel said END_TOKEN
most are forgotten while some , equally humble , become the points upon which history pivots END_TOKEN
i don’t really care what you did , highprince END_TOKEN
lighteyed self - indulgence or serious sacrilege , either way it doesn’t aff ct me END_TOKEN
but there are those who are asking how far you’re going to end up straying END_TOKEN
honestly , had he expected zahel of all people to be helpful END_TOKEN
he stood up and began to pace , annoyed at his own nervous energy END_TOKEN
before the ardents could return with someone for him to duel , he stalked back into the middle of the room , looking for soldiers he recognized END_TOKEN
men who wouldn’t feel inhibited sparring with a highprince END_TOKEN
he eventually located one of general khal’s sons END_TOKEN
not the shardbearer , captain halam khal , but the next oldest son—a beefy man with a head that had always seemed a little too small for his body END_TOKEN
he was stretching after some wrestling matches END_TOKEN
you ever sparred with a highprince END_TOKEN
the younger man turned , then immediately snapped to attention END_TOKEN
i’m just looking for a match END_TOKEN
i’m not equipped for a proper duel , brightlord , he said END_TOKEN
i’m fine for a wrestling match END_TOKEN
some men would rather not spar with a man as important as dalinar , for fear of hurting him END_TOKEN
khal had trained his sons better than that END_TOKEN
the young man grinned , displaying a prominent gap in his teeth END_TOKEN
but i’ll have you know , i’ve not lost a match in months END_TOKEN
the swordmasters finally returned as dalinar , stripped to the waist , was pulling on a pair of sparring leggings over his undershorts END_TOKEN
the tight leggings came down only to his knees END_TOKEN
he nodded to the swordmasters— ignoring the gentlemanly lighteyes they’d sought out for him to spar—and stepped into the wrestling ring with aratin khal END_TOKEN
his guards gave the swordmasters a kind of apologetic shrug , then rial counted off a start to the wrestling match END_TOKEN
dalinar immediately lunged forward and slammed into khal , grabbing him under the arms , struggling to hold his feet back and force his opponent off balance END_TOKEN
the wrestling match would eventually go to the ground , but you wanted to be the one who controlled when and how that happened END_TOKEN
there was no grabbing the leggings in a traditional vehah match , and of course no grabbing hair , so dalinar twisted , trying to get his opponent into a sturdy hold while preventing the man from shoving dalinar over END_TOKEN
dalinar scrambled , his muscles taut , his fingers slipping on his opponent’s skin END_TOKEN
for those frantic moments , he could focus only on the match END_TOKEN
his strength against that of his opponent END_TOKEN
sliding his feet , twisting his weight , straining for purchase END_TOKEN
there was a purity to the contest , a simplicity that he hadn’t experienced in what seemed like ages END_TOKEN
aratin pulled dalinar tight , then managed to twist , tripping dalinar over his hip END_TOKEN
they went to the mat , and dalinar grunted , raising his arm to his neck to prevent a chokehold , turning his head END_TOKEN
old training prompted him to twist and writhe before the opponent could get a good grip on him END_TOKEN
it had been years since he’d done this regularly END_TOKEN
the other man moved with dalinar’s twist , forgoing the attempt at a chokehold , instead getting dalinar under the arms from behind and pressing him down , face against the mat , his weight on top of dalinar END_TOKEN
dalinar growled , and by instinct reached out for that extra reserve he’d always had END_TOKEN
the pulse of the fight , the edge END_TOKEN
soldiers spoke of it in the quiet of the night , over campfires END_TOKEN
that battle rage unique to the alethi END_TOKEN
some called it the power of their ancestors , others the true mindset of the soldier END_TOKEN
it had driven the sunmaker to glory END_TOKEN
it was the open secret of alethi success END_TOKEN
dalinar stopped himself from reaching for it , but he needn’t have worried END_TOKEN
he couldn’t remember feeling the thrill in months—and the longer he’d been apart from it , the more he’d begun to recognize that there was something profoundly wrong about the thrill END_TOKEN
so he gritted his teeth and struggled—cleanly and fairly—with his opponent END_TOKEN
aratin was younger , more practiced at this style of fight END_TOKEN
dalinar didn’t make it easy , but he was on the bottom , lacked leverage , and simply wasn’t as young as he’d once been END_TOKEN
aratin twisted him over , and before too long dalinar found himself pressed to the mat , shoulders down , completely immobilized END_TOKEN
dalinar knew he was beaten , but couldn’t bring himself to tap out END_TOKEN
instead he strained against the hold , teeth gritted and sweat pouring down the sides of his face END_TOKEN
not the thrill… but stormlight in the pocket of his uniform trousers , lying beside the ring END_TOKEN
aratin grunted , arms like steel END_TOKEN
dalinar smelled his own sweat , the rough cloth of the mat END_TOKEN
he knew he could seize the stormlight power , but his sense of fairness protested at the mere thought END_TOKEN
instead he arched his back , holding his breath and heaving with everything he had , then twisted , trying to get back on his face for the leverage to escape END_TOKEN
then groaned , and dalinar felt the man’s grip slipping… slowly END_TOKEN
oh , for storm’s sake , a feminine voice said END_TOKEN
dalinar’s opponent let go immediately , backing away END_TOKEN
dalinar twisted , puffing from exertion , to find navani standing outside the ring with arms folded END_TOKEN
he grinned at her , then stood up and accepted a light takama over - shirt and towel from an aide END_TOKEN
as aratin khal retreated , dalinar raised a fist to him and bowed his head—a sign that dalinar considered aratin the victor END_TOKEN
dalinar threw on the takama , turning to navani and wiping his brow with the towel END_TOKEN
yes , what every wife loves , navani said END_TOKEN
seeing that in his spare time , her husband likes to roll around on the floor with half - naked , sweaty men END_TOKEN
shouldn’t you be sparring with men closer to your own age END_TOKEN
on the battlefield , dalinar said , i don’t have the luxury of choosing the age of my opponent END_TOKEN
best to fight at a disadvantage here to prepare END_TOKEN
he hesitated , then said more softly , i think i almost had him anyway END_TOKEN
your definition of ‘almost’ is particularly ambitious , gemheart END_TOKEN
dalinar accepted a waterskin from an aide END_TOKEN
though navani and her aides weren’t the only women in the room , the others were ardents END_TOKEN
navani in her bright yellow gown still stood out like a flower on a barren stone field END_TOKEN
as dalinar scanned the chamber , he found that many of the ardents— not just the swordmasters—failed to meet his gaze END_TOKEN
and there was kadash , his former comrade - in - arms , speaking with the swordmasters END_TOKEN
nearby , aratin was receiving congratulations from his friends END_TOKEN
pinning the blackthorn was considered quite the accomplishment END_TOKEN
the young man accepted their praise with a grin , but he held his shoulder and winced when someone slapped him on the back END_TOKEN
i should have tapped out , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
pushing the contest had endangered them both END_TOKEN
he’d specifically chosen someone younger and stronger , then became a poor loser END_TOKEN
getting older was something he needed to accept , and he was kidding himself if he actually thought this would help him on the battlefield END_TOKEN
he’d given away his armor , no longer carried a shardblade END_TOKEN
when exactly did he expect to be fighting in person again END_TOKEN
the water suddenly tasted stale in his mouth END_TOKEN
he’d been expecting to fight the enemy’s champion himself , assuming he could even make the contest happen to their advantage END_TOKEN
but wouldn’t assigning the duty to someone like kaladin make far more sense END_TOKEN
well , navani said , you might want to throw on a uniform END_TOKEN
the meeting isn’t for a few hours END_TOKEN
she wants to do it now END_TOKEN
apparently , her court tidereader saw something in the waves that means an earlier meeting is better END_TOKEN
she should be contacting us any minute END_TOKEN
still , they had an oathgate—two , if you counted the one in the kingdom of rira , which iri had sway over END_TOKEN
among iri’s three monarchs , currently two kings and a queen , the latter had authority over foreign policy , so she was the one they needed to talk to END_TOKEN
i’m fine with moving up the time , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i’ll await you in the writing chamber END_TOKEN
dalinar said , waving a hand END_TOKEN
it’s not like she can see me END_TOKEN
here , dalinar said , feeling stubborn END_TOKEN
i’ve had enough of cold chambers , silent save for the scratching of reeds END_TOKEN
navani raised an eyebrow at him , but ordered her assistants to get out their writing materials END_TOKEN
a worried ardent came over , perhaps to try to dissuade her—but after a few firm orders from navani , he went running to get her a bench and table END_TOKEN
dalinar smiled and went to select two training swords from a rack near the swordmasters END_TOKEN
he tossed one to kadash , who caught it smoothly , but then placed it in front of him with point down , resting his hands on the pommel END_TOKEN
brightlord , kadash said , i would prefer to give this task to another , as i don’t particularly feel—
i need some practice , kadash END_TOKEN
as your master , i demand you give it to me END_TOKEN
kadash stared at dalinar for a protracted moment , then let out an annoyed huff and followed dalinar to the ring END_TOKEN
i won’t be much of a match for you , brightlord END_TOKEN
i have dedicated my years to scripture , not the sword END_TOKEN
well , maybe i’ll be rusty too END_TOKEN
i haven’t fought with a common longsword in decades END_TOKEN
i remember when you first got your blade END_TOKEN
the world itself trembled on that day , dalinar kholin END_TOKEN
don’t be melodramatic , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i was merely one in a long line of idiots given the ability to kill people too easily END_TOKEN
rial hesitantly counted the start to the match , and dalinar rushed in swinging END_TOKEN
kadash rebuffed him competently , then stepped to the side of the ring END_TOKEN
pardon , brightlord , but you were different from the others END_TOKEN
you were much , much better at the killing part END_TOKEN
i always have been , dalinar thought , rounding kadash END_TOKEN
it was odd to remember the ardent as one of his elites END_TOKEN
they hadn’t been close then ; they’d only become so during kadash’s years as an ardent END_TOKEN
hate to interrupt this stick - wagging , she said , but the queen is ready to speak with you , dalinar END_TOKEN
great , he said , not taking his eyes off kadash END_TOKEN
he could practically feel navani roll her eyes END_TOKEN
he grinned , coming in at kadash again END_TOKEN
she thought he was being silly END_TOKEN
one at a time , the world’s monarchs were shutting him out END_TOKEN
only taravangian of kharbranth—known to be slow witted— had agreed to listen to him END_TOKEN
in an extended war campaign , he’d have forced himself to look at his problems from a new perspective END_TOKEN
bring in new officers to voice their ideas END_TOKEN
try to approach battles from different terrain END_TOKEN
dalinar clashed blades with kadash , smashing metal against metal END_TOKEN
‘highprince , ’ navani read as he fought , ‘it is with wondrous awe at the grandeur of the one that i approach you END_TOKEN
the time for the world to undergo a glorious new experience has arrived END_TOKEN
dalinar said , swiping at kadash’s leg END_TOKEN
surely you can’t welcome these events END_TOKEN
‘all experience is welcome , ’ came the reply END_TOKEN
‘we are the one experiencing itself—and this new storm is glorious even if it brings pain END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , blocking a backhand from kadash END_TOKEN
i hadn’t realized , navani noted , that she was so religious END_TOKEN
pagan superstition , kadash said , sliding back across the mat from dalinar END_TOKEN
at least the azish have the decency to worship the heralds , although they blasphemously place them above the almighty END_TOKEN
the iriali are no better than shin shamans END_TOKEN
i remember , kadash , dalinar said , when you weren’t nearly so judgmental END_TOKEN
i’ve been informed that my laxness might have served to encourage you END_TOKEN
i always found your perspective to be refreshing END_TOKEN
he stared right at kadash , but spoke to navani END_TOKEN
tell her : your majesty , as much as i welcome a challenge , i fear the suffering these new… experiences will bring END_TOKEN
we must be unified in the face of the coming dangers END_TOKEN
if that is your goal , dalinar , then why do you seek to rip apart your own people END_TOKEN
dalinar drew closer , passing his longsword from one hand to the other END_TOKEN
how do you know , kadash END_TOKEN
how do you know the iriali are the pagans END_TOKEN
though he wore the square beard of an ardent , that scar on his head wasn’t the only thing that set him apart from his fellows END_TOKEN
they treated swordplay like just another art END_TOKEN
kadash had the haunted eyes of a soldier END_TOKEN
when he dueled , he kept watch to the sides , in case someone tried to flank him END_TOKEN
an impossibility in a solo duel , but all too likely on a battlefield END_TOKEN
how can you ask that , dalinar END_TOKEN
because it should be asked , dalinar said END_TOKEN
you claim the almighty is god END_TOKEN
that isn’t good enough for me , dalinar said , realizing for the first time it was true END_TOKEN
the ardent growled , then leaped in , attacking with real determination this time END_TOKEN
dalinar danced backward , fending him off , as navani read— loudly END_TOKEN
‘highprince , i will be frank END_TOKEN
the iriali triumvirate is in agreement END_TOKEN
alethkar has not been relevant in the world since the sunmaker’s fall END_TOKEN
the power of the ones who control the new storm , however , is undeniable END_TOKEN
dalinar stopped in place , dumbfounded END_TOKEN
he asked toward navani , but then was forced to defend himself from kadash , who hadn’t let up END_TOKEN
kadash said , clanging his blade against dalinar’s END_TOKEN
surprised someone is willing to side with evil , dalinar END_TOKEN
that someone would pick darkness , superstition , and heresy instead of the almighty’s light END_TOKEN
dalinar slapped kadash’s blade away—but not before the ardent scored a touch on dalinar’s arm END_TOKEN
the hit was hard , and though the swords were blunted , that would bruise for certain END_TOKEN
you just told me you doubted the almighty , kadash said END_TOKEN
what is left , after that END_TOKEN
i don’t know , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i don’t know , and that terrifies me , kadash END_TOKEN
but honor spoke to me , confessed that he was beaten END_TOKEN
the princes of the voidbringers , kadash said , were said to be able to blind the eyes of men END_TOKEN
to send them lies , dalinar END_TOKEN
he rushed in , swinging , but dalinar danced back , retreating around the rim of the dueling ring END_TOKEN
‘my people , ’ navani said , reading the reply from the queen of iri , ‘do not want war END_TOKEN
perhaps the way to prevent another desolation is to let the voidbringers take what they wish END_TOKEN
from our histories , sparse though they are , it seems that this was the one option men never explored END_TOKEN
an experience from the one we rejected END_TOKEN
navani looked up , obviously as surprised to read the words as dalinar was to hear them END_TOKEN
‘beyond that , ’ she added , ‘we have reasons to distrust the word of a thief , highprince kholin END_TOKEN
so that was what this was all about—adolin’s shardplate END_TOKEN
find out more , try to console them END_TOKEN
she nodded , and started writing END_TOKEN
dalinar gritted his teeth and charged kadash again END_TOKEN
the ardent caught his sword , then grabbed his takama with his free hand , pulling him close , face to face END_TOKEN
the almighty is not dead , kadash hissed END_TOKEN
once , you’d have counseled me END_TOKEN
what happened to the ardent i knew END_TOKEN
a man who had lived a real life , not just watched the world from high towers and monasteries END_TOKEN
he’s frightened , kadash said softly END_TOKEN
that he’s somehow failed in his most solemn duty to a man he deeply admires END_TOKEN
they met eyes , their swords still locked , but neither one actually trying to push the other END_TOKEN
for a moment , dalinar saw in kadash the man he’d always been END_TOKEN
the gentle , understanding model of everything good about the vorin church END_TOKEN
give me something to take back to the curates of the church , kadash pled END_TOKEN
recant your insistence that the almighty is dead END_TOKEN
if you do that , i can make them accept the marriage END_TOKEN
kings have done worse and retained vorin support END_TOKEN
dalinar set his jaw , then shook his head END_TOKEN
falsehoods serve nobody , kadash , dalinar said , pulling back END_TOKEN
if the almighty is dead , then pretending otherwise is pure stupidity END_TOKEN
we need real hope , not faith in lies END_TOKEN
around the room , more than a few men had stopped their bouts to watch or listen END_TOKEN
the swordmasters had stepped up behind navani , who was still exchanging some politic words with the iriali queen END_TOKEN
don’t throw out everything we’ve believed because of a few dreams , dalinar , kadash said END_TOKEN
what of our society , what of tradition END_TOKEN
kadash , did i ever tell you about my first sword trainer END_TOKEN
no , kadash said , frowning , glancing at the other ardents END_TOKEN
back when i was young , our branch of the kholin family didn’t have grand monasteries and beautiful practice grounds END_TOKEN
my father found a teacher for me from two towns over END_TOKEN
young fellow , not a true swordmaster—but good enough END_TOKEN
he was very focused on proper procedure , and wouldn’t let me train until i’d learned how to put on a takama the right way END_TOKEN
dalinar gestured at the takama shirt he was wearing END_TOKEN
he wouldn’t have stood for me fighting like this END_TOKEN
you put on the skirt , then the overshirt , then you wrap your cloth belt around yourself three times and tie it END_TOKEN
the belt was too tight , wrapped three times—you had to pull it hard to get enough slack to tie the knot END_TOKEN
the first time i went to duels at a neighboring town , i felt like an idiot END_TOKEN
everyone else had long drooping belt ends at the front of their takamas END_TOKEN
i asked harth why we did it differently END_TOKEN
he said it was the right way , the true way END_TOKEN
so , when my travels took me to harth’s hometown , i searched out his master , a man who had trained with the ardents in kholinar END_TOKEN
he insisted that this was the right way to tie a takama , as he’d learned from his master END_TOKEN
by now , they’d drawn an even larger crowd END_TOKEN
i found my master’s master’s master in kholinar after we captured it , dalinar said END_TOKEN
the ancient , wizened ardent was eating curry and flatbread , completely uncaring of who ruled the city END_TOKEN
why tie your belt three times , when everyone else thinks you should do it twice END_TOKEN
the old man laughed and stood up END_TOKEN
i was shocked to see that he was terribly short END_TOKEN
‘if i only tie it twice , ’ he exclaimed , ‘the ends hang down so low , i trip END_TOKEN
nearby , one soldier chuckled , but quickly cut himself off—none of the ardents seemed amused END_TOKEN
i love tradition , dalinar said to kadash END_TOKEN
i make my men follow the codes END_TOKEN
but merely being tradition does not make something worthy , kadash END_TOKEN
we can’t just assume that because something is old it is right END_TOKEN
she’s not listening , navani said END_TOKEN
she insists you are a thief , not to be trusted END_TOKEN
i am led to believe that you would let nations fall , and men be slaughtered , because of a petty grievance from the past END_TOKEN
if my relations with the kingdom of rira are prompting you to consider supporting the enemies of all humankind , then perhaps we could discuss a personal reconciliation first END_TOKEN
navani nodded at that , though she glanced at the people watching and cocked an eyebrow END_TOKEN
she thought all this should have been done in private END_TOKEN
well , perhaps she was right END_TOKEN
at the same time , dalinar felt he’d needed this END_TOKEN
he raised his sword to kadash in a sign of respect END_TOKEN
in response , kadash came running at him , sword raised END_TOKEN
dalinar sighed , then let himself get touched on the left , but ended the exchange with his weapon leveled at kadash’s neck END_TOKEN
that’s not a valid dueling strike , the ardent said END_TOKEN
i’m not much of a duelist these days END_TOKEN
the ardent grunted , then shoved away dalinar’s weapon and lunged at him END_TOKEN
dalinar , however , caught kadash’s arm , then spun the man with his own momentum END_TOKEN
he slammed kadash down to the ground and held him there END_TOKEN
the world is ending , kadash , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i can’t simply rely on tradition END_TOKEN
offer me proof of what you say END_TOKEN
you shouldn’t need proof in the almighty END_TOKEN
i’ll take that as a compliment END_TOKEN
do you deny them , dalinar END_TOKEN
they were servants of the almighty , and their existence proved his END_TOKEN
murmuring rose from those watching as dalinar began to glow , then did… something else END_TOKEN
when he rose , he left kadash stuck to the ground in a pool of radiance that held him fast , binding him to the stone END_TOKEN
the knights radiant have returned , dalinar said END_TOKEN
and yes , i accept the authority of the heralds END_TOKEN
i accept that there was a being , once , named honor—the almighty END_TOKEN
he helped us , and i would welcome his help again END_TOKEN
if you can prove to me that vorinism as it currently stands is what the heralds taught , we will speak again END_TOKEN
he tossed his sword aside and stepped up to navani END_TOKEN
nice show , she said softly END_TOKEN
that was for the room , not just kadash , i assume END_TOKEN
the soldiers need to know where i stand in relation to the church END_TOKEN
she says you can contact her with arrangements for the return of the stolen goods , and she’ll consider END_TOKEN
you got that through marriage , and to a lighteyes from rira , not iri END_TOKEN
yes , the iriali claim their sister nation as a vassal , but even if the claim weren’t disputed , the queen doesn’t have any actual relation to evi or her brother END_TOKEN
rira was never strong enough to try to claim the plate back END_TOKEN
but if it will bring iri to our side , then i’d consider it END_TOKEN
maybe i can agree to… he trailed off END_TOKEN
say it again , dalinar whispered END_TOKEN
he staggered , then slumped against the writing table , feeling as if he’d been struck by a hammer to the head END_TOKEN
navani called for physicians , implying his dueling had overtaxed him END_TOKEN
instead , it was the burning in his mind , the sudden shock of a word spoken END_TOKEN
he could hear his wife’s name END_TOKEN
and he suddenly remembered her face END_TOKEN
it is not a lesson i claim to be able to teach END_TOKEN
experience herself is the great teacher , and you must seek her directly END_TOKEN
i still think we should kill him , khen—the parshwoman who had been playing cards—said to the others END_TOKEN
kaladin sat tied and bound to a tree END_TOKEN
they’d let him up several times to use the latrine today , but otherwise kept him bound END_TOKEN
though their knots were good , they always posted guards , even though he’d turned himself in to them in the first place END_TOKEN
his muscles were stiff , and the posture was uncomfortable , but he had endured worse as a slave END_TOKEN
almost the entire afternoon had passed so far— and they were still arguing about him END_TOKEN
he didn’t see that yellow - white spren again , the one that had been a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
he almost thought he’d imagined it END_TOKEN
at least the rain had finally stopped END_TOKEN
hopefully that meant the highstorms—and stormlight— were close to returning END_TOKEN
what danger is he to us END_TOKEN
he’ll tell others where we are END_TOKEN
he found us easily enough on his own END_TOKEN
i doubt others will have trouble , khen END_TOKEN
the parshmen didn’t seem to have a specific leader END_TOKEN
kaladin could hear them talking from where they stood , huddled together beneath a tarp END_TOKEN
the air smelled wet , and the clump of trees shivered when a gust of wind blew through END_TOKEN
a shower of water drops came down on top of him , somehow more cold than the weeping itself END_TOKEN
soon , blessedly , this would all dry up and he could finally see the sun again END_TOKEN
she had a gruff voice , angry END_TOKEN
would you actually do it , khen END_TOKEN
if it means they can’t take us again END_TOKEN
i won’t go back , ton END_TOKEN
they had simple , darkeyed alethi names—matched by their uncomfortably familiar accents END_TOKEN
kaladin didn’t worry for his safety ; though they’d taken his knife , spanreed , and spheres , he could summon syl at a moment’s notice END_TOKEN
she flitted nearby on gusts of wind , dodging between the branches of trees END_TOKEN
the parshmen eventually left their conference , and kaladin dozed END_TOKEN
he was later roused by the noise of them gathering up their meager belongings : an axe or two , some waterskins , the nearly ruined bags of grain END_TOKEN
as the sun set , long shadows stretched across kaladin , plunging the camp into darkness again END_TOKEN
it seemed that the group moved at night END_TOKEN
the tall male who had been playing cards the night before approached kaladin , who recognized the pattern of his skin END_TOKEN
he untied the ropes binding kaladin to the tree , the ones around his ankles—but left the bonds on kaladin’s hands END_TOKEN
you could capture that card , kaladin noted END_TOKEN
the card game , kaladin said END_TOKEN
the squire can capture if supported by an allied card END_TOKEN
the parshman grunted , yanking on the rope to tow kaladin to his feet END_TOKEN
he stretched , working stiff muscles and painful cramps , as the other parshmen broke down the last of the improvised tarp tents : the one that had been fully enclosed END_TOKEN
earlier in the day , though , kaladin had gotten a look at what was inside END_TOKEN
there were a dozen of them , dressed in smocks , of various ages from toddler to young teenager END_TOKEN
the females wore their hair loose , and the males wore theirs tied or braided END_TOKEN
they hadn’t been allowed to leave the tent except at a few carefully supervised moments , but he had heard them laughing END_TOKEN
he’d first worried they were captured human children END_TOKEN
as the camp broke , they scattered about , excited to finally be released END_TOKEN
one younger girl scampered across the wet stones and seized the empty hand of the man leading kaladin END_TOKEN
each of the children bore the distinctive look of their elders—the not - quite - parshendi appearance with the armored portions on the sides of their heads and forearms END_TOKEN
for the children , the color of the carapace was a light orange - pink END_TOKEN
kaladin couldn’t define why this sight seemed so strange to him END_TOKEN
parshmen did breed , though people often spoke of them being bred , like animals END_TOKEN
and , well , that wasn’t far from the truth , was it END_TOKEN
what would shen—rlain—think if kaladin had said those words out loud END_TOKEN
the procession moved out of the trees , kaladin led by his ropes END_TOKEN
they kept talk to a minimum , and as they crossed through a field in the darkness , kaladin had a distinct impression of familiarity END_TOKEN
had he been here before , done this before END_TOKEN
his captor said , speaking in a soft voice , but turning his head to direct the question at kaladin END_TOKEN
the king is one of the most powerful cards you can place , kaladin said , struggling to remember all the rules END_TOKEN
he can capture any other card except another king , and can’t be captured himself unless touched by three enemy cards of knight or better END_TOKEN
um… and he is immune to the soulcaster END_TOKEN
when i watched men play , they used this card rarely END_TOKEN
if it is so powerful , why delay END_TOKEN
if your king gets captured , you lose , kaladin said END_TOKEN
so you only play him if you’re desperate or if you are certain you can defend him END_TOKEN
half the times i’ve played , i left him in my barrack all game END_TOKEN
the parshman grunted , then looked to the girl at his side , who tugged on his arm and pointed END_TOKEN
he gave her a whispered response , and she ran on tiptoes toward a patch of flowering rockbuds , visible by the light of the first moon END_TOKEN
the vines pulled back , blossoms closing END_TOKEN
the girl , however , knew to squat at the side and wait , hands poised , until the flowers reopened—then she snatched one in each hand , her giggles echoing across the plain END_TOKEN
joyspren followed her like blue leaves as she returned , giving kaladin a wide berth END_TOKEN
khen , walking with a cudgel in her hands , urged kaladin’s captor to keep moving END_TOKEN
she watched the area with the nervousness of a scout on a dangerous mission END_TOKEN
that’s it , kaladin thought , remembering why this felt familiar END_TOKEN
it had happened after he’d been condemned by amaram , but before he’d been sent to the shattered plains END_TOKEN
he avoided thinking of those months END_TOKEN
his repeated failures , the systematic butchering of his last hints of idealism… well , he’d learned that dwelling on such things took him to dark places END_TOKEN
he’d failed so many people during those months END_TOKEN
nalma had been one of those END_TOKEN
he could remember the touch of her hand in his : a rough , callused hand END_TOKEN
that had been his most successful escape attempt END_TOKEN
you’re not monsters , kaladin whispered END_TOKEN
you’re not even the seeds of the void END_TOKEN
his captor spun , yanking on kaladin’s rope END_TOKEN
the parshman seized kaladin by the front of his uniform , and his daughter hid behind his leg , dropping one of her flowers and whimpering END_TOKEN
do you want me to kill you END_TOKEN
the parshman asked , pulling kaladin’s face close to his own END_TOKEN
you insist on reminding me how your kind see us END_TOKEN
look at my forehead , parshman END_TOKEN
storms… parshmen weren’t branded , and they didn’t mix with other slaves END_TOKEN
parshmen were actually too valuable for that END_TOKEN
when they make a human into a slave , kaladin said , they brand him END_TOKEN
and you think that makes you understand END_TOKEN
i have spent my entire life living in a fog , the parshman yelled at him END_TOKEN
every day knowing i should say something , do something to stop this END_TOKEN
every night clutching my daughter , wondering why the world seems to move around us in the light—while we are trapped in shadows END_TOKEN
because she had birthed a healthy child , which made her good breeding stock END_TOKEN
do you understand that , human END_TOKEN
do you understand watching your family be torn apart , and knowing you should object—knowing deep in your soul that something is profoundly wrong END_TOKEN
can you know that feeling of being unable to say a single storming word to stop it END_TOKEN
the parshman pulled him even closer END_TOKEN
they may have taken your freedom , but they took our minds END_TOKEN
he dropped kaladin and whirled , gathering up his daughter and holding her close as he jogged to catch up to the others , who had turned back at the outburst END_TOKEN
kaladin followed , yanked by his rope , stepping on the little girl’s flower in his forced haste END_TOKEN
syl zipped past , and when kaladin tried to catch her attention , she just laughed and flew higher on a burst of wind END_TOKEN
his captor suffered several quiet chastisements when they caught up ; this column couldn’t afford to draw attention END_TOKEN
kaladin walked with them , and remembered END_TOKEN
you were never free while you ran ; you felt as if the open sky and the endless fields were a torment END_TOKEN
you could feel the pursuit following , and each morning you awoke expecting to find yourself surrounded END_TOKEN
until one day you were right END_TOKEN
he’d accepted shen into bridge four , yes END_TOKEN
but accepting that a sole parshman could be a bridgeman was starkly different from accepting the entire people as… well , human END_TOKEN
as the column stopped to distribute waterskins to the children , kaladin felt at his forehead , tracing the scarred shape of the glyphs there END_TOKEN
they’d tried to take his mind too END_TOKEN
they’d beaten him to the stones , stolen everything he loved , and murdered his brother END_TOKEN
left him unable to think straight END_TOKEN
life had become a blur until one day he’d found himself standing over a ledge , watching raindrops die and struggling to summon the motivation to end his life END_TOKEN
syl soared past in the shape of a shimmering ribbon END_TOKEN
i need to talk to you END_TOKEN
hush , she said , then giggled and zipped around him before flitting over and doing the same to his captor END_TOKEN
like she’d been back before they forged their bond END_TOKEN
is something wrong with the bond END_TOKEN
it’s not that , she said , speaking in a furious whisper END_TOKEN
i think parshmen might be able to see me END_TOKEN
and that other spren is still here too END_TOKEN
a higher spren , like me END_TOKEN
he’s invisible to you , syl said , becoming a group of leaves and blowing around him END_TOKEN
i think i’ve fooled him into thinking i’m just a windspren END_TOKEN
she zipped away , leaving a dozen unanswered questions on kaladin’s lips END_TOKEN
storms… is that spren how they know where to go END_TOKEN
the column started again , and kaladin walked for a good hour in silence before syl next decided to come back to him END_TOKEN
she landed on his shoulder , becoming the image of a young woman in her whimsical skirt END_TOKEN
he’s gone ahead for a little bit , she said END_TOKEN
the spren is guiding them , kaladin said under his breath END_TOKEN
syl , this spren must be…
from him , she whispered , wrapping her arms around herself and growing small—actively shrinking to about two - thirds her normal size END_TOKEN
these parshmen… how do they know how to talk , how to act END_TOKEN
yes , they’ve spent their lives around society—but to be this , well , normal after such a long time half asleep END_TOKEN
power has filled the holes in their souls , bridging the gaps END_TOKEN
they didn’t just wake , kaladin END_TOKEN
they’ve been healed , connection refounded , identity restored END_TOKEN
there’s more to this than we ever realized END_TOKEN
somehow when you conquered them , you stole their ability to change forms END_TOKEN
you literally ripped off a piece of their souls and locked it away END_TOKEN
i will stay nearby , in case you need a blade END_TOKEN
she left , zipping straight into the air as a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
kaladin continued to shuffle behind the column , chewing on her words , before speeding up and stepping beside his captor END_TOKEN
you’re being smart , in some ways , kaladin said END_TOKEN
it’s good to travel at night END_TOKEN
but you’re following the riverbed over there END_TOKEN
i know it makes for more trees , and more secure camping , but this is literally the first place someone would look for you END_TOKEN
several of the other parshmen gave him glances from nearby END_TOKEN
the big group is an issue too , kaladin added END_TOKEN
you should break into smaller groups and meet up each morning , so if you get spotted you’ll seem less threatening END_TOKEN
you can say you were sent somewhere by a lighteyes , and travelers might let you go END_TOKEN
if they run across all seventy of you together , there’s no chance of that END_TOKEN
this is all assuming , of course , you don’t want to fight—which you don’t END_TOKEN
if you fight , they’ll call out the highlords against you END_TOKEN
for now they’ve got bigger problems END_TOKEN
i can help you , kaladin said END_TOKEN
i might not understand what you’ve been through , but i do know what it feels like to run END_TOKEN
you will want us to be caught END_TOKEN
i’m not sure i do , kaladin said , truthful END_TOKEN
his captor said nothing more and kaladin sighed , dropping back into position behind END_TOKEN
why had the everstorm not granted these parshmen powers like those on the shattered plains END_TOKEN
what of the stories of scripture and lore END_TOKEN
they eventually stopped for another break , and kaladin found himself a smooth rock to sit against , nestled into the stone END_TOKEN
his captor tied the rope to a nearby lonely tree , then went to confer with the others END_TOKEN
kaladin leaned back , lost in thought until he heard a sound END_TOKEN
he was surprised to find his captor’s daughter approaching END_TOKEN
she carried a waterskin in two hands , and stopped right beyond his reach END_TOKEN
she didn’t have shoes , and the walk so far had not been kind to her feet , which—though tough with calluses—were still scored by scratches and scrapes END_TOKEN
she timidly set the waterskin down , then backed away END_TOKEN
she didn’t flee , as kaladin might have expected , when he reached for the water END_TOKEN
thank you , he said , then took a mouthful END_TOKEN
it was pure and clear— apparently the parshmen knew how to settle and scoop their water END_TOKEN
he ignored the rumbling of his stomach END_TOKEN
by mishim’s pale green light , he decided this girl was not as timid as he had assumed END_TOKEN
she was nervous , but she met his eyes with hers END_TOKEN
why can’t they just let us go END_TOKEN
could you go back and tell them END_TOKEN
we just want to go away END_TOKEN
they have a lot of work to do in rebuilding , and they’ll want the extra hands END_TOKEN
you are a… resource they can’t simply ignore END_TOKEN
the humans he’d visited hadn’t known to expect some terrible voidbringer force ; many thought their parshmen had merely run off in the chaos END_TOKEN
what did we do to them END_TOKEN
i never hit anyone , even when i was mad END_TOKEN
i didn’t mean you specifically , kaladin said END_TOKEN
your ancestors—the people like you from long ago END_TOKEN
there was a war , and…
how did you explain slavery to a seven - year - old END_TOKEN
he tossed the waterskin to her , and she scampered back to her father—who had only just noticed her absence END_TOKEN
he stood , a stark silhouette in the night , studying kaladin END_TOKEN
they’re talking about making camp , syl whispered from nearby END_TOKEN
she had crawled into a crack in the rock END_TOKEN
the voidspren wants them to march on through the day , but i don’t think they’re going to END_TOKEN
they’re worried about their grain spoiling END_TOKEN
is that spren watching me right now END_TOKEN
he turned and hid what he was doing , then quickly summoned syl as a knife to cut himself free END_TOKEN
that would change his eye color , but in the darkness , he hoped the parshmen wouldn’t notice END_TOKEN
syl puffed back into a spren END_TOKEN
the spheres they took from you have all run out , but they’ll scatter at seeing a blade END_TOKEN
kaladin instead picked up a large stone END_TOKEN
the parshmen hushed , noticing his escape END_TOKEN
kaladin carried his rock a few steps , then dropped it , crushing a rockbud END_TOKEN
he was surrounded a few moments later by angry parshmen carrying cudgels END_TOKEN
kaladin ignored them , picking through the wreckage of the rockbud END_TOKEN
he held up a large section of shell END_TOKEN
the inside of this , he said , turning it over for them , will still be dry , despite the rainfall END_TOKEN
the rockbud needs a barrier between itself and the water outside for some reason , though it always seems eager to drink after a storm END_TOKEN
if you scrape off this inner layer , kaladin said , tapping at the rockbud shell , you can get to the dry portion END_TOKEN
now that the rain has stopped , i should be able to get us a fire going , assuming nobody has lost my tinder bag END_TOKEN
we need to boil that grain , then dry it into cakes END_TOKEN
they won’t be tasty , but they’ll keep END_TOKEN
if you don’t do something soon , your supplies will rot END_TOKEN
since we’re already here , we should be near enough the river that we can gather more water END_TOKEN
it won’t flow much longer with the end of the rains END_TOKEN
rockbud shells don’t burn particularly well , so we’ll want to harvest some real wood and dry it at the fire during the day END_TOKEN
we can keep that one small , then do the cooking tomorrow night END_TOKEN
in the dark , the smoke is less likely to reveal us , and we can shield the light in the trees END_TOKEN
i just have to figure out how we’re going to cook without any pots to boil the water END_TOKEN
then khen finally pushed him away from the rockbud and took up the shard he’d been holding END_TOKEN
kaladin spotted his original captor standing near the rock where kaladin had been sitting END_TOKEN
the parshman held the rope kaladin had cut , rubbing its sliced - through end with his thumb END_TOKEN
after a short conference , the parshmen dragged him to the trees he’d indicated , returned his knife—standing by with every cudgel they had— and demanded that he prove he could build a fire with wet wood END_TOKEN
you cannot have a spice described to you , but must taste it for yourself END_TOKEN
stormlight made her face less youthful , more angular END_TOKEN
nose pointed , with a small scar on the chin END_TOKEN
her hair rippled from red to alethi black END_TOKEN
making an illusion like this took a larger gem of stormlight , but once it was going , she could maintain it for hours on just a smidgen END_TOKEN
veil tossed aside the havah , instead pulling on trousers and a tight shirt , then boots and a long white coat END_TOKEN
she finished with only a simple glove on the left hand END_TOKEN
veil , of course , wasn’t in the least embarrassed at that END_TOKEN
there was a simple relief for shallan’s pain END_TOKEN
there was an easy way to hide END_TOKEN
veil hadn’t suffered as shallan had—and she was tough enough to handle that sort of thing anyway END_TOKEN
becoming her was like setting down a terrible burden END_TOKEN
veil threw a scarf around her neck , then slung a rugged satchel— acquired for veil specifically—over her shoulder END_TOKEN
hopefully the conspicuous knife handle sticking out from the top would look natural , even intimidating END_TOKEN
the part at the back of her mind that was still shallan worried about this END_TOKEN
she’d almost certainly missed some subtle clues encoded in her behavior , dress , or speech END_TOKEN
these would indicate to the right people that veil didn’t have the hard - bitten experience she feigned END_TOKEN
well , she would have to do her best and hope to recover from her inevitable mistakes END_TOKEN
she tied another knife onto her belt , long , but not quite a sword , since veil wasn’t lighteyed END_TOKEN
no lighteyed woman would be able to prance around so obviously armed END_TOKEN
some mores grew lax the farther you descended the social ladder END_TOKEN
veil asked , turning to the wall , where pattern hung END_TOKEN
you slip in and out of her , pattern said , like the sun behind clouds END_TOKEN
i just need more practice , veil said END_TOKEN
yes , that voice sounded excellent END_TOKEN
shallan was getting far better with sounds END_TOKEN
she picked pattern up—which involved pressing her hand against the wall , letting him pass over to her skin and then her coat END_TOKEN
with him humming happily , she crossed her room and stepped out onto the balcony END_TOKEN
the first moon had risen , violet and proud salas END_TOKEN
she was the least bright of the moons , which meant it was mostly dark out END_TOKEN
most rooms on the outside had these small balconies , but hers on the second level was particularly advantageous END_TOKEN
it had steps down to the field below END_TOKEN
covered in furrows for water and ridges for planting rockbuds , the field also had boxes at the edges for growing tubers or ornamental plants END_TOKEN
each tier of the city had a similar one , with eighteen levels inside separating them END_TOKEN
she stepped down to the field in the darkness END_TOKEN
how had anything ever grown up here END_TOKEN
her breath puffed out in front of her , and coldspren grew around her feet END_TOKEN
the field had a small access doorway back into urithiru END_TOKEN
perhaps the subterfuge of not exiting through her room wasn’t necessary , but veil preferred to be careful END_TOKEN
she wouldn’t want guards or servants remarking on how brightness shallan went about during odd hours of the night END_TOKEN
besides , who knew where mraize and his ghostbloods had operatives END_TOKEN
they hadn’t contacted her since that first day in urithiru , but she knew they’d be watching END_TOKEN
she still didn’t know what to do about them END_TOKEN
they had admitted to assassinating jasnah , which should be grounds enough to hate them END_TOKEN
they also seemed to know things , important things , about the world END_TOKEN
veil strolled through the corridor , carrying a small hand lamp for light , as a sphere would make her stand out END_TOKEN
she passed evening crowds that kept the corridors of sebarial’s quarter as busy as his warcamp had been END_TOKEN
things never seemed to slow down here as much as they did in dalinar’s quarter END_TOKEN
the strangely mesmerizing strata of the corridors guided her out of sebarial’s quarter END_TOKEN
the number of people in the hallways slackened END_TOKEN
just veil and those lonely , endless tunnels END_TOKEN
she felt as if she could sense the weight of the other levels of the tower , empty and unexplored , bearing down on her END_TOKEN
she hurried on her way , pattern humming to himself from her coat END_TOKEN
i like him , pattern said END_TOKEN
the one you can’t mate with yet END_TOKEN
can we please stop talking about him that way END_TOKEN
i have come to understand , pattern said , growing excited END_TOKEN
humans… humans don’t care about the dead END_TOKEN
you build chairs and doors out of corpses END_TOKEN
you make clothing from the skins of corpses END_TOKEN
well , i guess that’s true END_TOKEN
he seemed unnaturally excited by the revelation END_TOKEN
it is grotesque , he continued , but you all must kill and destroy to live END_TOKEN
it is the way of the physical realm END_TOKEN
so i should not hate adolin kholin for wielding a corpse END_TOKEN
you just like him , veil said , because he tells radiant to respect the sword END_TOKEN
yes , very , very nice man END_TOKEN
why don’t you marry him , then END_TOKEN
he settled down into a contented buzz on her coat , where he appeared as a strange kind of embroidery END_TOKEN
after a short time walking , shallan found she needed to say something more END_TOKEN
do you remember what you said to me the other night , the first time… we became radiant END_TOKEN
it may be the only way , shallan END_TOKEN
mmm… you must speak truths to progress , but you will hate me for making it happen END_TOKEN
so i can die , and once done you can—
no , please don’t leave me END_TOKEN
i hate myself too , she whispered END_TOKEN
pattern seemed pleased by this , as his humming increased—though his sounds of pleasure and his sounds of agitation could be similar END_TOKEN
for the moment , veil let herself be distracted by the night’s quest END_TOKEN
adolin continued his efforts to find the murderer , but hadn’t gotten far END_TOKEN
aladar was highprince of information , and his policing force and scribes were a resource—but adolin wanted badly to do as his father asked END_TOKEN
veil thought that perhaps both were looking in the wrong places END_TOKEN
she finally saw lights ahead and quickened her pace , eventually stepping out onto a walkway around a large cavernous room that stretched up several stories END_TOKEN
she had reached the breakaway : a vast collection of tents lit by many flickering candles , torches , or lanterns END_TOKEN
the market had sprung up shockingly fast , in defiance of navani’s carefully outlined plans END_TOKEN
her idea had been for a grand thoroughfare with shops along the sides END_TOKEN
no alleyways , no shanties or tents END_TOKEN
the merchants had rebelled , complaining about lack of storage space , or the need to be closer to a well for fresh water END_TOKEN
in reality , they wanted a larger market that was much harder to regulate END_TOKEN
sebarial , as highprince of commerce , had agreed END_TOKEN
and despite having made a mess of his ledgers , he was sharp when it came to trade END_TOKEN
the chaos and variety of it excited veil END_TOKEN
hundreds of people , despite the hour , attracting spren of a dozen varieties END_TOKEN
dozens upon dozens of tents of varied colors and designs END_TOKEN
in fact , some weren’t tents at all , but were better described as stands—roped - off sections of ground guarded by a few burly men with cudgels END_TOKEN
small stone sheds that had been built inside this cavern , here since the days of the radiants END_TOKEN
merchants from all ten original warcamps mixed at the breakaway END_TOKEN
she passed three different cobblers in a row ; veil had never understood why merchants selling the same things congregated END_TOKEN
wouldn’t it be better to set up where you wouldn’t have competition literally next door END_TOKEN
she packed away her hand lamp , as there was plenty of light here from the merchant tents and shops , and sauntered along END_TOKEN
veil felt more comfortable than she had in those empty , twisted corridors ; here , life had gained a foothold END_TOKEN
the market grew like the snarl of wildlife and plants on the leeward side of a ridge END_TOKEN
she made her way to the cavern’s central well : a large , round enigma that rippled with crem - free water END_TOKEN
she’d never seen an actual well before— everyone normally used cisterns that refilled with the storms END_TOKEN
the many wells in urithiru , however , never ran out END_TOKEN
the water level didn’t even drop , despite people constantly drawing from them END_TOKEN
scribes talked about the possibility of a hidden aquifer in the mountains , but where would the water come from END_TOKEN
snows at the tops of the peaks nearby didn’t seem to melt , and rain fell very rarely END_TOKEN
veil sat on the well’s side , one leg up , watching the people who came and went END_TOKEN
she listened to the women chatter about the voidbringers , about family back in alethkar , and about the strange new storm END_TOKEN
she listened to the men worry about being pressed into the military , or about their darkeyed nahn being lowered , now that there weren’t parshmen to do common work END_TOKEN
some lighteyed workers complained about supplies trapped back in narak , waiting for stormlight before they could be transferred here END_TOKEN
veil eventually ambled off toward a particular row of taverns END_TOKEN
i can’t interrogate too hard to get my answers , she thought END_TOKEN
if i ask the wrong kind of questions , everyone will figure me for some kind of spy for aladar’s policing force END_TOKEN
she’d lift her chin in challenge to anyone who seemed to be sizing her up END_TOKEN
power was an illusion of perception END_TOKEN
veil had her own kind of power , that of a lifetime spent on the streets knowing she could take care of herself END_TOKEN
she had the stubbornness of a chull , and while she was cocky , that confidence was a power of its own END_TOKEN
she got what she wanted and wasn’t embarrassed by success END_TOKEN
the first bar she chose was inside a large battle tent END_TOKEN
it smelled of spilled lavis beer and sweaty bodies END_TOKEN
men and women laughed , using overturned crates as tables and chairs END_TOKEN
most wore simple darkeyed clothing : laced shirts—no money or time for buttons—and trousers or skirts END_TOKEN
a few men dressed after an older fashion , with a wrap and a loose filmy vest that left the chest exposed END_TOKEN
this was a low - end tavern , and likely wouldn’t work for her needs END_TOKEN
she’d need a place that was lower , yet somehow richer END_TOKEN
more disreputable , but with access to the powerful members of the warcamp undergrounds END_TOKEN
still , this seemed a good place to practice END_TOKEN
the bar was made of stacked boxes and had some actual chairs beside it END_TOKEN
veil leaned against the bar in what she hoped was a smooth way , and nearly knocked the boxes over END_TOKEN
she stumbled , catching them , then smiled sheepishly at the bartender—an old darkeyed woman with grey hair END_TOKEN
let them see that veil could handle the hard stuff END_TOKEN
we got vari , kimik , and a nice barrel of veden END_TOKEN
that one will cost you though END_TOKEN
uh… adolin would have known the differences END_TOKEN
the woman made her pay first , with dun spheres , but the cost didn’t seem outrageous END_TOKEN
sebarial wanted the liquor flowing—his suggested way to make sure tensions didn’t get too high in the tower—and had subsidized the prices with low taxes , for now END_TOKEN
while the woman worked behind her improvised bar , veil suffered beneath the gaze of one of the bouncers END_TOKEN
those didn’t stay near the entrance , but instead waited here , beside the liquor and the money END_TOKEN
despite what aladar’s policing force would like , this place was not completely safe END_TOKEN
if unexplained murders had been glossed over or forgotten , they would have happened in the breakaway , where the clutter , worry , and press of tens of thousands of camp followers balanced on the edge of lawlessness END_TOKEN
the barkeep plunked a cup in front of veil—a tiny cup , with a clear liquid in it END_TOKEN
veil scowled , holding it up END_TOKEN
you got mine wrong , barkeep ; i ordered sapphire END_TOKEN
the bouncer nearest veil snickered , and the barkeep stopped in place , then looked her over END_TOKEN
apparently shallan had already made one of those mistakes she’d been worried about END_TOKEN
kid , the barkeep said , somehow leaning on the boxes near her and not knocking any over END_TOKEN
that’s the same stuff , just without the fancy infusions the lighteyes put in theirs END_TOKEN
you some kind of house servant END_TOKEN
out for your first night on your own END_TOKEN
of course not , veil said END_TOKEN
i’ve done this a hundred times END_TOKEN
sure , sure , the woman replied , tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear END_TOKEN
i might have some wines back here done with lighteyed colors , for you END_TOKEN
in fact , i know i’ve got a nice orange END_TOKEN
she reached to reclaim the cup END_TOKEN
veil seized it and knocked the entire thing back in a single gulp END_TOKEN
that proved to be one of the worst mistakes of her life END_TOKEN
the liquid burned , like it was on fire END_TOKEN
she felt her eyes go wide , and she started coughing and almost threw up right there on the bar END_TOKEN
what was wrong with these people END_TOKEN
there was no sweetness to it at all , not even a hint of flavor END_TOKEN
just that burning sensation , like someone was scraping her throat with a scouring brush END_TOKEN
the bouncer was holding his face , trying—and failing—not to laugh out loud END_TOKEN
the barkeep patted shallan on the back as she kept coughing END_TOKEN
here , the woman said , let me get you something to chase that—
i’m just happy to be able to drink this… again after so long END_TOKEN
the barkeep seemed skeptical , though the bouncer was all for it—he’d settled down on the stool to watch shallan , grinning END_TOKEN
shallan placed a sphere on the bar , defiant , and the barkeep reluctantly filled her cup again END_TOKEN
by now , three or four other people from nearby seats had turned to watch END_TOKEN
shallan braced herself , then drank the wine in a long , extended gulp END_TOKEN
it wasn’t any better the second time END_TOKEN
she held for a moment , eyes watering , then let out an explosion of coughing END_TOKEN
she ended up hunched over , shaking , eyes squeezed closed END_TOKEN
she was pretty sure she let out a long squeak as well END_TOKEN
several people in the tent clapped END_TOKEN
shallan looked back at the amused barkeep , her eyes watering END_TOKEN
that was awful , she said , then coughed END_TOKEN
you really drink this dreadful liquid END_TOKEN
oh , hon , the woman said END_TOKEN
that’s not nearly as bad as they get END_TOKEN
yes , shallan said with a sigh END_TOKEN
she probably wasn’t going to be establishing a reputation for herself tonight—at least not the type she wanted END_TOKEN
but she could try to accustom herself to drinking this cleaning fluid END_TOKEN
her stomach did not like what she was doing to it , and she shoved down a bout of nausea END_TOKEN
still chuckling , the bouncer moved a seat closer to her END_TOKEN
he was a younger man , with hair cut so short it stood up on end END_TOKEN
he was as alethi as they came , with a deep tan skin and a dusting of black scrub on his chin END_TOKEN
you should try sipping it , he said to her END_TOKEN
that way i can savor the terrible flavor END_TOKEN
wine is supposed to be sweet END_TOKEN
depends on how you make it , he said as the barkeep gave shallan another cup END_TOKEN
sapphire can sometimes be distilled tallew , no natural fruit in it—just some coloring for accent END_TOKEN
but they don’t serve the really hard stuff at lighteyed parties , except to people who know how to ask for it END_TOKEN
you know your alcohol , veil said END_TOKEN
the room shook for a moment before settling END_TOKEN
then she tried another drink—a sip this time END_TOKEN
it comes with the job , he said with a broad smile END_TOKEN
i work a lot of fancy events for the lighteyes , so i know my way around a place with tablecloths instead of boxes END_TOKEN
they need bouncers at fancy lighteyed events END_TOKEN
sure , he said , cracking his knuckles END_TOKEN
you just have to know how to ‘escort’ someone out of the feast hall , instead of throwing them out END_TOKEN
but strangely , more dangerous at the same time END_TOKEN
kelek , veil realized as he scooted closer END_TOKEN
she probably shouldn’t have found it so surprising END_TOKEN
she’d come in alone , and while shallan would never have described veil as cute , she wasn’t ugly END_TOKEN
she was kind of normal , if rugged , but she dressed well and obviously had money END_TOKEN
her face and hands were clean , her clothing—while not rich silks—a generous step up from worker garb END_TOKEN
initially she was offended by his attention END_TOKEN
here she’d gone to all this trouble to make herself capable and hard as rocks , and the first thing she did was attract some guy END_TOKEN
one who cracked his knuckles and tried to tell her how to drink her alcohol END_TOKEN
just to spite him , she downed the rest of her cup in a single shot END_TOKEN
she immediately felt guilty for her annoyance at the man END_TOKEN
granted , adolin could have destroyed this man in any conceivable way END_TOKEN
adolin even cracked his knuckles louder END_TOKEN
the bouncer nodded , as if he’d expected that END_TOKEN
sebarial’s camp had been the most eclectic END_TOKEN
they chatted a little longer , mostly with shallan making the odd comment while the bouncer—his name was jor—went off on various stories with many tangents END_TOKEN
he wasn’t too bad , though he didn’t seem to care what she actually said , so long as it prompted him to keep talking END_TOKEN
she drank some more of the terrible liquid , but found her mind wandering END_TOKEN
these people… they each had lives , families , loves , dreams END_TOKEN
some slumped at their boxes , lonely , while others laughed with friends END_TOKEN
some kept their clothing , poor though it was , reasonably clean—others were stained with crem and lavis ale END_TOKEN
several of them reminded her of tyn , the way they talked with confidence , the way their interactions were a subtle game of one - upping each other END_TOKEN
jor paused , as if expecting something from her END_TOKEN
what… what had he been saying END_TOKEN
following him was getting harder , as her mind drifted END_TOKEN
he smiled , and launched into another story END_TOKEN
i’m not going to be able to imitate this , she thought , leaning against her box , until i’ve lived it END_TOKEN
no more than i could draw their lives without having walked among them END_TOKEN
the barkeep came back with the bottle , and shallan nodded END_TOKEN
that last cup hadn’t burned nearly as much as the others END_TOKEN
storms… she was starting to feel really sick END_TOKEN
she’d had four cups , yes , but they were little cups END_TOKEN
the room spun in a blur , and she groaned , resting her head on the table END_TOKEN
beside her , the bouncer sighed END_TOKEN
i could have told you that you were wasting your time , jor , the barkeep said END_TOKEN
this one will be out before the hour is done END_TOKEN
wonder what she’s trying to forget…
she’s just enjoying a little free time , jor said END_TOKEN
hey , jor said , nudging shallan END_TOKEN
i’ll call you a palanquin to cart you home END_TOKEN
you should get going before things go too late END_TOKEN
i know some porters who can be trusted END_TOKEN
it’s… not even late yet… shallan mumbled END_TOKEN
shallan asked , a glimmer of memory waking inside of her END_TOKEN
never happens here in this area , at least not yet END_TOKEN
so i… so i can stay away… shallan said END_TOKEN
someone got stabbed behind one of the taverns just last night there END_TOKEN
shallan stood up to go , but the room upended about her , and she found herself slipping down beside her stool END_TOKEN
jor tried to catch her , but she hit the ground with a thump , knocking her elbow against the stone floor END_TOKEN
she immediately sucked in a little stormlight to help with the pain END_TOKEN
the cloud around her mind puffed away , and her vision stopped spinning END_TOKEN
in a striking moment , her drunkenness simply vanished END_TOKEN
she stood up without jor’s help , dusting off her coat and then pulling her hair back away from her face END_TOKEN
thanks , she said , but that’s exactly the information i need END_TOKEN
the woman turned , then froze , staring at shallan , pouring liquid into a cup until it overflowed END_TOKEN
shallan picked up her cup , then turned it and shook the last drop into her mouth END_TOKEN
that’s good stuff , she noted END_TOKEN
thanks for the conversation , jor END_TOKEN
she set a sphere on the boxes as a tip , pulled on her hat , then patted jor fondly on the cheek before striding out of the tent END_TOKEN
did i just get played for a fool END_TOKEN
it was still busy out , reminding her of kharbranth , with its midnight markets END_TOKEN
neither sun nor moon could penetrate to these halls ; it was easy to lose track of time END_TOKEN
beyond that , while most people had been put immediately to work , many of the soldiers had free time without plateau runs to do any longer END_TOKEN
shallan asked around , and managed to get pointed toward all’s alley END_TOKEN
the stormlight made me sober , she said to pattern , who had crawled up her coat and now dimpled her collar , folded over the top END_TOKEN
you drank the poison on purpose , didn’t you END_TOKEN
yes , but the point wasn’t to get drunk END_TOKEN
i didn’t do a very good job in there END_TOKEN
you gave it a good effort END_TOKEN
as soon as i got drunk , as soon as i lost control , veil slipped away from me END_TOKEN
veil was a woman who didn’t giggle when she got drunk , or whine , fanning her mouth when the drink was too hard for her END_TOKEN
she never acted like a silly teenager END_TOKEN
veil hadn’t been sheltered , practically locked away , until she went crazy and murdered her own family END_TOKEN
shallan stopped in place , suddenly frantic END_TOKEN
pattern , i didn’t kill them , right END_TOKEN
i talked to balat over spanreed , shallan said , hand to her forehead END_TOKEN
but… i had lightweaving then… even if i didn’t fully know it END_TOKEN
shallan , pattern said , sounding concerned END_TOKEN
they are on their way here END_TOKEN
she adopted veil again , her pain fading END_TOKEN
this is… mmm… there is something wrong with these lies you place upon yourself END_TOKEN
i just need to go deeper , she whispered END_TOKEN
i can’t be veil only on the surface END_TOKEN
pattern buzzed with a soft , anxious vibration—fast paced , high pitched END_TOKEN
veil hushed him as she reached all’s alley END_TOKEN
a strange name for a tavern , but she had seen stranger END_TOKEN
it wasn’t an alley at all , but a big set of five tents sewn together , each a different color END_TOKEN
a bouncer stood out front , short and squat , with a scar running up his cheek , across his forehead , and onto his scalp END_TOKEN
he gave veil a critical looking - over , but didn’t stop her as she sauntered—full of confidence— into the tent END_TOKEN
it smelled worse than the other pub , with all these drunken people crammed together END_TOKEN
the tents had been sewn to create partitioned - off areas , darkened nooks—and a few had tables and chairs instead of boxes END_TOKEN
the people who sat at them didn’t wear the simple clothing of workers , but instead leathers , rags , or unbuttoned military coats END_TOKEN
both richer than the other tavern , veil thought , and lower at the same time END_TOKEN
she rambled through the room , which—despite oil lamps on some tables—was quite dim END_TOKEN
the bar was a plank set across some boxes , but they’d draped a cloth over the middle END_TOKEN
a few people waited for drinks ; veil ignored them END_TOKEN
what’s the strongest thing you’ve got END_TOKEN
she asked the barkeep , a fat man in a takama END_TOKEN
she thought he might be lighteyed END_TOKEN
it was too dim to tell for certain END_TOKEN
if i wanted water , i’d go to the well END_TOKEN
the barkeep grunted , then reached behind himself and took out a jug of something clear , with no label END_TOKEN
horneater white , he said , thumping it down on the table END_TOKEN
i have no idea what they ferment to make the stuff , but it takes paint off real nicely END_TOKEN
perfect , veil said , clacking a few spheres onto the improvised counter END_TOKEN
the others in line had been shooting her glares for ignoring the line , but at this their expressions turned to amusement END_TOKEN
the barkeep poured veil a very small cup of the stuff and set it before her END_TOKEN
she downed it in one gulp END_TOKEN
shallan trembled inside at the burning that followed—the immediate warmth to her cheeks and almost instant sense of nausea , accompanied by a tremor through her muscles as she tried to resist throwing up END_TOKEN
she held her breath to stifle the nausea , and relished the sensations END_TOKEN
no worse than the pains already inside , she thought , warmth radiating through her END_TOKEN
those idiots beside the bar continued to gawk as she poured another cup of the horneater white and downed it , feeling its warmth END_TOKEN
she turned to inspect the tent’s occupants END_TOKEN
aladar’s scribes had checked watch records for anyone else killed the same way as sadeas , and they’d come up empty—but a killing in an alleyway might not get reported END_TOKEN
she hoped that the people here would know of it regardless END_TOKEN
she poured some more of that horneater drink END_TOKEN
though it was even fouler - tasting than the veden saph , she found something strangely appealing about it END_TOKEN
she downed the third cup , but drew in a tiny bit of stormlight from a sphere in her pouch—just a smidge that instantly burned away and didn’t make her glow—to heal herself END_TOKEN
she said , eyeing the people in line at the bar END_TOKEN
they turned away as the bartender moved to put a stopper on the jug END_TOKEN
veil put her hand on top of it END_TOKEN
i’m not done with that yet END_TOKEN
you are , the bartender said , brushing her hand away END_TOKEN
one of two things is going to happen if you continue like that END_TOKEN
you’ll either puke all over my bar , or you’ll drop dead END_TOKEN
you’re not a horneater ; this will kill you END_TOKEN
the mess is mine , the barkeep said , yanking the jug back END_TOKEN
i’ve seen your type , with that haunted look END_TOKEN
you’ll get yourself drunk , then pick a fight END_TOKEN
i don’t care what it is you want to forget ; go find some other place to do it END_TOKEN
getting kicked out of the most disreputable bar in the market END_TOKEN
well , at least her reputation wouldn’t suffer here END_TOKEN
she caught the barkeep’s arm as he pulled it back END_TOKEN
i’m not here to tear your bar down , friend , she said softly END_TOKEN
someone who was killed here a few days back END_TOKEN
i’m hunting the man who killed my little sister END_TOKEN
and that has to do with my bar how END_TOKEN
i’ve heard rumors of a body found near here END_TOKEN
a grown woman , the barkeep said END_TOKEN
my sister didn’t die here , veil said END_TOKEN
she died back in the warcamps ; i’m just hunting the one who did it END_TOKEN
she hung on as the barkeep tried to pull away again END_TOKEN
i’m not going to make trouble END_TOKEN
i hear there were… unusual circumstances about this death END_TOKEN
the man who killed my sister , he has something strange about him END_TOKEN
he kills in the same way every time END_TOKEN
let him see , veil thought END_TOKEN
let him see a woman with a hard edge , but wounds inside END_TOKEN
a story reflected in her eyes—a narrative she needed this man to believe END_TOKEN
the one who did it , the barkeep said softly , has already been dealt with END_TOKEN
i need to know if your murderer is the same one i’ve been hunting , veil said END_TOKEN
i need details of the killing , however gruesome they may be END_TOKEN
i can’t say anything , the barkeep whispered , but he nodded toward one of the alcoves made from the stitched - together tents , where shadows indicated some people were drinking END_TOKEN
just your everyday , ordinary thugs , the barkeep said END_TOKEN
but they’re the ones i pay to keep my bar out of trouble END_TOKEN
if someone had disturbed this establishment in a way that risked the authorities shutting the place down— as that aladar is so fond of doing—those are the people who would have taken care of said problem END_TOKEN
veil nodded in thanks , but didn’t let go of his arm END_TOKEN
she tapped her cup and cocked her head hopefully END_TOKEN
the barkeep sighed and gave her one more hit of the horneater white , which she paid for , then sipped as she walked away END_TOKEN
the alcove he’d indicated held a single table full of a variety of ruffians END_TOKEN
the men wore the clothing of the alethi upper crust : jackets and stiff uniform - style trousers , belts and buttoned shirts END_TOKEN
here , their jackets were undone , their shirts loose END_TOKEN
two of the women even wore the havah , though another was in trousers and a jacket , not too different from what veil wore END_TOKEN
the whole group reminded her of tyn in the way they lounged in an almost deliberate way END_TOKEN
it took effort to look so indifferent END_TOKEN
there was an unoccupied seat , so veil strolled right in and took it END_TOKEN
the lighteyed woman across from her hushed a jabbering man by touching his lips END_TOKEN
she wore the havah , but without a safehand sleeve—instead , she wore a glove with the fingers brazenly cut off at the knuckles END_TOKEN
that’s ur’s seat , the woman said to veil END_TOKEN
when he gets back from the pisser , you’d best have moved on END_TOKEN
then i’ll be quick , veil said , downing the rest of her drink , savoring the warmth END_TOKEN
a woman was found dead here END_TOKEN
i think the murderer might have also killed someone dear to me END_TOKEN
i’ve been told the murderer was ‘dealt with , ’ but i need to know for myself END_TOKEN
hey , said a foppish man wearing a blue jacket , with slits in the outer layer to show yellow underneath END_TOKEN
you’re the one that was drinking the horneater white END_TOKEN
old sullik only keeps that jug as a joke END_TOKEN
the woman in the havah laced her fingers before herself , inspecting veil END_TOKEN
look , veil said , just tell me what the information will cost me END_TOKEN
one can’t buy , the woman said , what isn’t for sale END_TOKEN
everything is for sale , veil said , if you ask the right way END_TOKEN
look , veil said , trying to catch the woman’s eyes END_TOKEN
a hand fell on shallan’s shoulder , and she looked up to find an enormous horneater man standing behind her END_TOKEN
storms , he had to be nearly seven feet tall END_TOKEN
this , he said , drawing out the i sound to an e instead , is my spot END_TOKEN
he pulled veil off the chair , tossing her backward to roll on the ground , her cup tumbling away , her satchel twisting and getting wound up in her arms END_TOKEN
she came to a rest , blinking as the large man sat on the chair END_TOKEN
she felt she could hear its soul groaning in protest END_TOKEN
veil growled , then stood up END_TOKEN
she yanked off her satchel and dropped it , then removed a handkerchief and the knife from inside END_TOKEN
this knife was narrow and pointed , long but thinner than the one on her belt END_TOKEN
she picked up her hat and dusted it off before replacing it and strolling back up to the table END_TOKEN
shallan disliked confrontation , but veil loved it END_TOKEN
well , well , she said , resting her safehand on the top of the large horneater’s left hand , which was lying flat on the tabletop END_TOKEN
you say it’s your place , but i don’t see it marked with your name END_TOKEN
the horneater stared at her , confused by the strangely intimate gesture of putting her safehand on his hand END_TOKEN
let me show you , she said , removing her knife and placing the point onto the back of her hand , which was pressed against his END_TOKEN
you put on an act , being tough END_TOKEN
veil rammed the knife down through her hand , through his , and into the tabletop END_TOKEN
the horneater screamed , whipping his hand upward , making veil pull the knife out of both hands END_TOKEN
the man toppled out of his chair as he scrambled away from her END_TOKEN
veil settled down in it again END_TOKEN
she took the cloth from her pocket and wrapped it around her bleeding hand END_TOKEN
that would obscure the cut when she healed it END_TOKEN
which she didn’t do at first END_TOKEN
it would need to be seen bleeding END_TOKEN
instead—a part of her surprised at how calm she remained—she retrieved her knife , which had fallen beside the table END_TOKEN
the horneater said , recovering his feet , holding his bleeding hand END_TOKEN
oh wait , veil said , tapping the table with her knife END_TOKEN
look , i see your mark here , in blood END_TOKEN
suppose you can sit in my lap , if you want END_TOKEN
ur said , shooting a glare at the people in the main room of the tent , who had crowded around the entrance to this smaller room , whispering END_TOKEN
quiet , ur , the woman in the havah said END_TOKEN
you think , the woman said to veil , assaulting my friends is going to make me more likely to talk END_TOKEN
honestly , i just wanted the seat back END_TOKEN
veil shrugged , scratching at the tabletop with her knife END_TOKEN
but if you want me to start hurting people , i suppose i could do that END_TOKEN
you really are crazy , betha said END_TOKEN
i just don’t consider your little group a threat END_TOKEN
i’ve tried being nice , and my patience is running thin END_TOKEN
it’s time to tell me what i want to know before this turns ugly END_TOKEN
betha frowned , then glanced at what veil had scratched into the tabletop END_TOKEN
veil gambled that the woman would know what it meant END_TOKEN
they seemed the type who would—small - time thugs , yes , but ones with a presence in an important market END_TOKEN
veil wasn’t certain how secretive mraize and his people were with their symbol , but the fact that they got it tattooed on their bodies indicated to her that it wasn’t supposed to be terribly secret END_TOKEN
more a warning , like cremlings who displayed red claws to indicate they were poisonous END_TOKEN
indeed , the moment betha saw the symbol , she gasped softly END_TOKEN
we… we want nothing to do with your type , betha said END_TOKEN
one of the men at the table stood up , trembling , and looked from side to side , as if expecting assassins to tackle him right then END_TOKEN
even cutting the hand of one of their members hadn’t provoked this strong a reaction END_TOKEN
curiously though , one of the other women at the table—a short , younger woman wearing a havah—leaned forward , interested END_TOKEN
we had ur drop him off the plateau outside , betha said END_TOKEN
but… how could this be a man you would be interested in END_TOKEN
drunk , from sadeas’s camp , said one of the men END_TOKEN
angry drunk ; always got into trouble END_TOKEN
killed his wife , betha said END_TOKEN
pity too , after she followed him all the way out here END_TOKEN
guess none of us had much choice , with that crazy storm END_TOKEN
and this ned , veil said , murdered his wife with a knife through the eye END_TOKEN
betha shook her head , seeming confused END_TOKEN
so it was a dead end END_TOKEN
but i heard that the murder was strange END_TOKEN
no , the standing man said , then settled back down beside betha , knife out END_TOKEN
he set it on the table , in front of them END_TOKEN
we knew ned would go too far at some point END_TOKEN
i don’t think any of us was surprised when , after she tried to drag him away from the tavern that night , he finally went over the edge END_TOKEN
at least once ur got hold of him END_TOKEN
it appears , veil said , standing up , that i have wasted your time END_TOKEN
i will leave spheres with the barkeep ; your tab is my debt , tonight END_TOKEN
she spared a glance for ur , who hunched nearby and regarded her with a sullen expression END_TOKEN
she waved her bloodied fingers at him , then made her way back toward the main tent room of the tavern END_TOKEN
she hovered just inside it , contemplating her next move END_TOKEN
her hand throbbed , but she ignored it END_TOKEN
perhaps she’d been foolish to think she could solve in a few hours what adolin had spent weeks trying to crack END_TOKEN
oh , don’t look so sullen , ur , betha said from behind , voice drifting out of the tent alcove END_TOKEN
at least it was just your hand END_TOKEN
considering who that was , it could have been a lot worse END_TOKEN
but why was she so interested in ned END_TOKEN
is she going to come back because i killed him END_TOKEN
she wasn’t after him , one of the other women snapped END_TOKEN
ain’t nobody that cares ned killed poor rem END_TOKEN
course , it could have been about the other woman he killed END_TOKEN
veil felt a shock run through her END_TOKEN
she spun , striding back into the alcove END_TOKEN
ur whimpered , hunching down and holding his wounded hand END_TOKEN
i was going to tell you , but you left so fast that—
we’d have let the watch take care of ned , but he couldn’t leave it at killing just poor rem END_TOKEN
we protect this place , you see END_TOKEN
so ur had to take a long walk with ned END_TOKEN
the man with the knife rubbed his chin END_TOKEN
strangest thing , that he’d come back and kill a barmaid the next night END_TOKEN
left her body right around the corner from where he killed poor rem END_TOKEN
he screamed the whole time we were taking him to his fall that he hadn’t killed the second one , ur muttered END_TOKEN
that barmaid was strangled the exact same way as rem , body dropped in the same position END_TOKEN
even had the marks of his ring scraping her chin like rem did END_TOKEN
her light brown eyes had a hollow cast to them , like she was staring at the body again , as it had been found END_TOKEN
another double murder , veil thought END_TOKEN
veil felt dazed , though she didn’t know if it was from drink or the unwelcome image of the strangled women END_TOKEN
she went and gave the barkeep some spheres—probably too many—and hooked the jug of horneater white with her thumb , then carted it out with her into the night END_TOKEN
a candle flickered on the table , and dalinar lit the end of his napkin in it , sending a small braid of pungent smoke into the air END_TOKEN
didn’t they use spheres because they were better than candles for light END_TOKEN
at a glare from gavilar , dalinar stopped burning his napkin and leaned back , nursing a mug of deep violet wine END_TOKEN
the kind you could smell from across the room , potent and flavorful END_TOKEN
a feast hall spread before him , dozens of tables set on the floor of the large stone room END_TOKEN
the place was far too warm , and sweat prickled on his arms and forehead END_TOKEN
outside the feast hall , a storm raged like a madman who’d been locked away , impotent and ignored END_TOKEN
but how do you deal with highstorms , brightlord END_TOKEN
the tall , blond - haired westerner sat with them at the high table END_TOKEN
good planning keeps an army from needing to be out during a storm except in rare situations , gavilar explained END_TOKEN
if a campaign takes longer than anticipated , we can split the army and retreat back to a number of these towns for shelter END_TOKEN
and if you’re in the middle of a siege END_TOKEN
sieges are rare out here , brightlord toh , gavilar said , chuckling END_TOKEN
surely there are cities with fortifications , toh said END_TOKEN
your famed kholinar has majestic walls , does it not END_TOKEN
the westerner had a thick accent and spoke in a clipped , annoying way END_TOKEN
you’re forgetting about soulcasters , gavilar said END_TOKEN
yes , sieges happen now and then , but it’s very hard to starve out a city’s soldiers while there are soulcasters and emeralds to make food END_TOKEN
instead we usually break down the walls quickly , or—more commonly—we seize the high ground and use that vantage to pound the city for a while END_TOKEN
we have not these things in rira or iri END_TOKEN
fascinating , fascinating… and so many shards here END_TOKEN
perhaps half the world’s wealth of blades and plates , all contained in vorin kingdoms END_TOKEN
dalinar took a long pull on his wine END_TOKEN
outside , thunder shook the bunker END_TOKEN
the highstorm was in full force now END_TOKEN
inside , servants brought out slabs of pork and lanka claws for the men , cooked in a savory broth END_TOKEN
the women dined elsewhere , including , he’d heard , toh’s sister END_TOKEN
the two western lighteyes had arrived barely an hour before the storm hit END_TOKEN
the hall soon echoed with the sounds of people chatting END_TOKEN
dalinar tore into his lanka claws , cracking them with the bottom of his mug and biting out the meat END_TOKEN
where was the music , the laughter END_TOKEN
life had been different these last few years of conquest END_TOKEN
the final four highprinces stood firm in their unified front END_TOKEN
the once - frantic fighting had stalled END_TOKEN
more and more of gavilar’s time was required by the administration of his kingdom—which was half as big as they wanted it to be , but still demanding END_TOKEN
gavilar and sadeas didn’t make dalinar play at it too often , but he still had to sit at feasts like this one , rather than dining with his men END_TOKEN
he sucked on a claw , watching gavilar talk to the foreigner END_TOKEN
gavilar actually looked regal , with his beard combed like that , glowing gemstones on his fingers END_TOKEN
he wore a uniform of the newer style END_TOKEN
dalinar instead wore his skirtlike takama and an open overshirt that went down to midthigh , his chest bare END_TOKEN
sadeas held court with a group of lesser lighteyes at a table across the hall END_TOKEN
every one of that group had been carefully chosen : men with uncertain loyalties END_TOKEN
he’d talk , persuade , convince END_TOKEN
and if he was worried , he’d find ways to eliminate them END_TOKEN
not with assassins , of course END_TOKEN
they all found that sort of thing distasteful ; it wasn’t the alethi way END_TOKEN
instead , they’d maneuver the man into a duel with dalinar , or would position him at the front of an assault END_TOKEN
ialai , sadeas’s wife , spent an impressive amount of time cooking up new schemes for getting rid of problematic allies END_TOKEN
dalinar finished the claws , then turned toward his pork , a succulent slab of meat swimming in gravy END_TOKEN
the food was better at this feast END_TOKEN
he just wished that he didn’t feel so useless here END_TOKEN
gavilar made alliances ; sadeas dealt with problems END_TOKEN
those two could treat a feast hall like a battlefield END_TOKEN
dalinar reached to his side for his knife so he could cut the pork END_TOKEN
he’d lent it to teleb , hadn’t he END_TOKEN
he stared down at the pork , smelling its peppery sauce , his mouth watering END_TOKEN
he reached to eat with his fingers , then thought to look up END_TOKEN
everyone else was eating primly , with utensils END_TOKEN
but the servers had forgotten to bring him a knife END_TOKEN
he sat back , wagging his mug for more wine END_TOKEN
nearby , gavilar and that foreigner continued their chat END_TOKEN
your campaign here has been impressive , brightlord kholin , toh said END_TOKEN
one sees a glint of your ancestor in you , the great sunmaker END_TOKEN
hopefully , gavilar noted , my accomplishments won’t be as ephemeral as his END_TOKEN
you shouldn’t speak so of one like him END_TOKEN
we all are , gavilar said END_TOKEN
house kholin , house sadeas… all ten princedoms END_TOKEN
their founders were his sons , you know END_TOKEN
so yes , signs of his touch are here—yet his empire didn’t last even a single generation past his death END_TOKEN
leaves me wondering what was wrong with his vision , his planning , that his great empire broke apart so quickly END_TOKEN
dalinar tried to catch the attention of a servant to request a dinner knife , but they were too busy scuttling about , seeing to the needs of other demanding feastgoers END_TOKEN
he sighed , then stood—stretching—and walked to the door , holding his empty mug END_TOKEN
lost in thought , he threw aside the bar on the door , then shoved open the massive wooden construction and stepped outside END_TOKEN
a sheet of icy rain suddenly washed over his skin , and wind blasted him fiercely enough that he stumbled END_TOKEN
the highstorm was at its raging height , lightning blasting down like vengeful attacks from the heralds END_TOKEN
dalinar struck out into the storm , his overshirt whipping about him END_TOKEN
gavilar talked more and more about things like legacy , the kingdom , responsibility END_TOKEN
what had happened to the fun of the fight , to riding into battle laughing END_TOKEN
thunder crashed , and the periodic strikes of lightning were barely enough to see by END_TOKEN
still , dalinar knew his way around well enough END_TOKEN
this was a highstorm waystop , a place built to house patrolling armies during storms END_TOKEN
he and gavilar had been positioned at this one for a good four months now , drawing tribute from the nearby farms and menacing house evavakh from just inside its borders END_TOKEN
dalinar found the particular bunker he was looking for and pounded on the door END_TOKEN
so he summoned his shardblade , slid the tip between the double doors , and sliced the bar inside END_TOKEN
he pushed open the door to find a group of wide - eyed armed men scrambling into defensive lines , surrounded by fearspren , weapons held in nervous grips END_TOKEN
teleb , dalinar said , standing in the doorway END_TOKEN
did i lend you my belt knife END_TOKEN
my favorite one , with the whitespine ivory on the grip END_TOKEN
the tall soldier , who stood in the second rank of terrified men , gaped at him END_TOKEN
lost the thing somewhere , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i lent it to you , didn’t i END_TOKEN
i gave it back , sir , teleb said END_TOKEN
you used it to pry that splinter out of your saddle , remember END_TOKEN
what did i do with that blasted thing END_TOKEN
dalinar left the doorway and strode back out into the storm END_TOKEN
perhaps dalinar’s worries had more to do with himself than they did gavilar END_TOKEN
the kholin battles were so calculated these days—and these last months had been more about what happened off the battlefield than on it END_TOKEN
it all seemed to leave dalinar behind like the discarded shell of a cremling after it molted END_TOKEN
an explosive burst of wind drove him against the wall , and he stumbled , then stepped backward , driven by instincts he couldn’t define END_TOKEN
a large boulder slammed into the wall , then bounced away END_TOKEN
dalinar glanced and saw something luminous in the distance : a gargantuan figure that moved on spindly glowing legs END_TOKEN
dalinar stepped back up to the feast hall , gave the whatever - it - was a rude gesture , then pushed open the door—throwing aside two servants who had been holding it closed—and strode back in END_TOKEN
streaming with water , he walked up to the high table , where he flopped into his chair and set down his mug END_TOKEN
now he was wet and he still couldn’t eat his pork END_TOKEN
a sea of eyes stared at him END_TOKEN
gavilar asked , the only sound in the room END_TOKEN
lost my storming knife , dalinar said END_TOKEN
thought i’d left it in the other bunker END_TOKEN
he raised his mug and took a loud , lazy slurp of rainwater END_TOKEN
excuse me , lord gavilar , toh stammered END_TOKEN
i… i find myself in need of refreshment END_TOKEN
the blond - haired westerner stood from his place , bowed , and retreated across the room to where a master - servant was administering drinks END_TOKEN
his face seemed even paler than those folk normally were END_TOKEN
dalinar asked , scooting his chair closer to his brother END_TOKEN
i assume , gavilar said , sounding amused , that people he knows don’t casually go for strolls in highstorms END_TOKEN
this is a fortified waystop , with walls and bunkers END_TOKEN
we needn’t be scared of a little wind END_TOKEN
toh thinks differently , i assure you END_TOKEN
you may have just proven in one moment , dalinar , a point i’ve spent a half hour trying to make politically END_TOKEN
toh wonders if we’re strong enough to protect him END_TOKEN
is that what the conversation was about END_TOKEN
dalinar picked at a claw on gavilar’s plate END_TOKEN
what does it take to get one of these fancy servants to get me a storming knife END_TOKEN
they’re master - servants , dalinar , his brother said , making a sign by raising his hand in a particular way END_TOKEN
the sign of need , remember END_TOKEN
you really need to pay better attention , gavilar said END_TOKEN
we aren’t living in huts anymore END_TOKEN
they were kholin , heirs to one of the world’s great cities—even if dalinar had never seen the place before his twelfth year END_TOKEN
he didn’t like that gavilar was buying into the story the rest of the kingdom told , the one that claimed their branch of the house had until recently been ruffians from the backwaters of their own princedom END_TOKEN
a gaggle of servants in black and white flocked to gavilar , and he requested a new dining knife for dalinar END_TOKEN
as they split to run the errand , the doors to the women’s feast hall opened , and a figure slipped in END_TOKEN
navani’s hair glowed with the tiny rubies she’d woven into it , a color matched by her pendant and bracelet END_TOKEN
her face a sultry tan , her hair alethi jet black , her red - lipped smile so knowing and clever END_TOKEN
and a figure… a figure to make a man weep for desire END_TOKEN
dalinar steeled himself and raised his arm in a gesture like the one gavilar had made END_TOKEN
a serving man stepped up with a springy gait END_TOKEN
brightlord , he said , i will see to your desires of course , though you might wish to know that the sign is off END_TOKEN
if you’ll allow me to demonstrate—
wine , dalinar said , wagging his mug END_TOKEN
enough to fill this three times at least END_TOKEN
and what vintage would you like , brightlord END_TOKEN
navani slipped between tables , followed by the squatter form of ialai sadeas END_TOKEN
neither seemed to care that they were the only lighteyed women in the room END_TOKEN
she slid between dalinar and gavilar as a servant brought her a chair END_TOKEN
dalinar scared him off , gavilar said END_TOKEN
the scent of her perfume was heady END_TOKEN
dalinar scooted his chair to the side and set his face END_TOKEN
be firm , don’t let her know how she warmed him , brought him to life like nothing else but battle END_TOKEN
ialai pulled a chair over for herself , and a servant brought dalinar’s wine END_TOKEN
he took a long , calming drink straight from the jug END_TOKEN
we’ve been assessing the sister , ialai said , leaning in from gavilar’s other side END_TOKEN
—but i’m reasonably sure she’s being honest END_TOKEN
the brother seems the same , gavilar said , rubbing his chin and inspecting toh , who was nursing a drink near the bar END_TOKEN
he’s a sycophant , dalinar said with a grunt END_TOKEN
he’s a man without a home , dalinar , ialai said END_TOKEN
no loyalty , at the mercy of those who take him in END_TOKEN
and he has only one piece he can play to secure his future END_TOKEN
taken from his homeland of rira and brought east , as far as toh could get from his kinsmen—who were reportedly outraged to find such a precious heirloom stolen END_TOKEN
he doesn’t have the armor with him , gavilar said END_TOKEN
he’s at least smart enough not to carry it END_TOKEN
he’ll want assurances before giving it to us END_TOKEN
look how he stares at dalinar , navani said END_TOKEN
dalinar ran his hand through his hair END_TOKEN
he hadn’t been embarrassed to stare down the crowd in the room , but before her he found himself blushing END_TOKEN
you’re kidding , ialai said , scooting over as sadeas joined them at the high table END_TOKEN
the bulbous - faced man settled down on her chair with her , the two of them sitting half on , half off END_TOKEN
he dropped a plate on the table , piled with claws in a bright red sauce END_TOKEN
she was one of the few women dalinar knew who liked masculine food END_TOKEN
sadeas asked , waving away a master - servant with a chair , then draping his arm around his wife’s shoulders END_TOKEN
we’re talking about getting dalinar married , ialai said END_TOKEN
dalinar demanded , choking on a mouthful of wine END_TOKEN
that is the point of this , right END_TOKEN
they want someone who can protect them , someone their family will be too afraid to attack END_TOKEN
but toh and his sister , they’ll want more than just asylum END_TOKEN
they’ll want to be part of things END_TOKEN
inject their blood into the royal line , so to speak END_TOKEN
you could try water sometime you know , dalinar , sadeas said END_TOKEN
there wasn’t enough wine in the world to prepare him for the gaze behind the smile , so piercing , so appraising END_TOKEN
this could be what we need , gavilar said END_TOKEN
it gives us not only the shard , but the appearance of speaking for alethkar END_TOKEN
if people outside the kingdom start coming to me for refuge and treaties , we might be able to sway the remaining highprinces END_TOKEN
we might be able to unite this country not through further war , but through sheer weight of legitimacy END_TOKEN
a servant , at long last , arrived with a knife for dalinar END_TOKEN
he took it eagerly , then frowned as the woman walked away END_TOKEN
dalinar asked , pinching the dainty knife between two fingers and dangling it END_TOKEN
how am i supposed to eat a pork steak with this END_TOKEN
attack it , ialai said , making a stabbing motion END_TOKEN
pretend it’s some thick - necked man who has been insulting your biceps END_TOKEN
if someone insulted my biceps , i wouldn’t attack him , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i’d refer him to a physician , because obviously something is wrong with his eyes END_TOKEN
navani laughed , a musical sound END_TOKEN
oh , dalinar , sadeas said END_TOKEN
i don’t think there’s another person on roshar who could have said that with a straight face END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , then tried to maneuver the little knife into cutting the steak END_TOKEN
the meat was growing cold , but still smelled delicious END_TOKEN
a single hungerspren started flitting about his head , like a tiny brown fly of the type you saw out in the west near the purelake END_TOKEN
sunmaker , gavilar said , looking from navani , to sadeas , to dalinar END_TOKEN
why did he fail to create a lasting empire END_TOKEN
his kids were too greedy , dalinar said , sawing at his steak END_TOKEN
there wasn’t one of them that the others would agree to support END_TOKEN
no , that’s not it , navani said END_TOKEN
they might have united , if the sunmaker himself could have been bothered to settle on an heir END_TOKEN
he was off in the west , gavilar said END_TOKEN
leading his army to ‘further glory END_TOKEN
’ alethkar and herdaz weren’t enough for him END_TOKEN
so it was his ambition , sadeas said END_TOKEN
no , his greed , gavilar said quietly END_TOKEN
what’s the point of conquering if you can never sit back and enjoy it END_TOKEN
shubreth - son - mashalan , sunmaker , even the hierocracy… they all stretched farther and farther until they collapsed END_TOKEN
in all the history of mankind , has any conqueror decided they had enough END_TOKEN
has any man just said , ‘this is good END_TOKEN
this is what i wanted , ’ and gone home END_TOKEN
right now , dalinar said , what i want is to eat my storming steak END_TOKEN
he held up the little knife , which was bent in the middle END_TOKEN
how in the almighty’s tenth name did you do that END_TOKEN
gavilar stared with that distant , far - off look in his green eyes END_TOKEN
a look that was becoming more and more common END_TOKEN
why are we at war , brother END_TOKEN
look , it’s not so complicated END_TOKEN
can’t you remember how it was back when we started END_TOKEN
well , dalinar said , wagging his bent knife END_TOKEN
we looked at this place here , this kingdom , and we realized , ‘hey , all these people have stuff END_TOKEN
’ and we figured… hey , maybe we should have that stuff END_TOKEN
oh dalinar , sadeas said , chuckling END_TOKEN
don’t you ever think about what it meant though END_TOKEN
when people fight , it’s about the stuff that’s it END_TOKEN
there’s something i want you to listen to END_TOKEN
the codes of war , from the old days END_TOKEN
dalinar nodded absently as the serving staff entered with teas and fruit to close the meal ; one tried to take his steak , and he growled at her END_TOKEN
as she backed away , dalinar caught sight of something END_TOKEN
a woman peeking into the room from the other feast hall END_TOKEN
she wore a delicate , filmy dress of pale yellow , matched by her blonde hair END_TOKEN
toh’s sister evi was eighteen , maybe nineteen END_TOKEN
she was tall , almost as tall as an alethi , and small of chest END_TOKEN
in fact , there was a certain sense of flimsiness to her , as if she were somehow less real than an alethi END_TOKEN
the same went for her brother , with his slender build END_TOKEN
it made her stand out , like a candle’s glow in a dark room END_TOKEN
she scampered across the feast hall to her brother , who handed her a drink END_TOKEN
she tried to take it with her left hand , which was tied inside a small pouch of yellow cloth END_TOKEN
the dress didn’t have sleeves , strangely END_TOKEN
she kept trying to eat with her safehand , navani said , eyebrow cocked END_TOKEN
ialai leaned down the table toward dalinar , speaking conspiratorially END_TOKEN
they go about half - clothed out in the far west , you know END_TOKEN
rirans , iriali , the reshi END_TOKEN
they aren’t as inhibited as these prim alethi women END_TOKEN
i bet she’s quite exotic in the bedroom END_TOKEN
in the hand hidden behind the back of a server clearing gavilar’s plates END_TOKEN
dalinar kicked at his brother’s chair , breaking a leg off and sending gavilar toppling to the ground END_TOKEN
the assassin swung at the same moment , clipping gavilar’s ear , but otherwise missing END_TOKEN
the wild swing struck the table , driving the knife into the wood END_TOKEN
dalinar leaped to his feet , reaching over gavilar and grabbing the assassin by the neck END_TOKEN
he spun the would - be killer around and slammed him to the floor with a satisfying crunch END_TOKEN
still in motion , dalinar grabbed the knife from the table and pounded it into the assassin’s chest END_TOKEN
puffing , dalinar stepped back and wiped the rainwater from his eyes END_TOKEN
gavilar sprang to his feet , shardblade appearing in his hand END_TOKEN
he looked down at the assassin , then at dalinar END_TOKEN
dalinar kicked at the assassin to be sure he was dead END_TOKEN
he nodded to himself , righted his chair , sat down , then leaned over and yanked the man’s knife from his chest END_TOKEN
he washed it off in his wine , then cut off a piece of his steak and shoved it into his mouth END_TOKEN
good pork , dalinar noted around the bite END_TOKEN
across the room , toh and his sister were staring at dalinar with looks that mixed awe and terror END_TOKEN
he caught a few shockspren around them , like triangles of yellow light , breaking and re - forming END_TOKEN
thank you , gavilar said , touching his ear and the blood that was dripping from it END_TOKEN
you probably wanted to question him , eh END_TOKEN
it’s no stretch to guess who sent him , gavilar said , settling down , waving away the guards who—belatedly—rushed to help END_TOKEN
navani clutched his arm , obviously shaken by the attack END_TOKEN
an alethi should be ashamed of such action END_TOKEN
again , everyone in the feast was gawking at the high table END_TOKEN
dalinar cut his steak again , shoving another piece into his mouth END_TOKEN
he wasn’t going to drink the wine he’d washed the blood into END_TOKEN
i know i said i wanted you free to make your own choice in regard to a bride , gavilar said END_TOKEN
i’ll do it , dalinar said , eyes forward END_TOKEN
he needed to just storming accept that END_TOKEN
they’re timid and careful , navani noted , dabbing at gavilar’s ear with her napkin END_TOKEN
it might take more time to persuade them END_TOKEN
oh , i wouldn’t worry about that , gavilar said , looking back at the corpse END_TOKEN
dalinar is nothing if not persuasive END_TOKEN
however , with a dangerous spice , you can be warned to taste lightly END_TOKEN
i would that your lesson may not be as painful as my own END_TOKEN
now this , kaladin said , isn’t actually that serious a wound END_TOKEN
i know it looks deep , but it’s often better to be cut deep by a sharp knife than to be raggedly gouged by something dull END_TOKEN
he pressed the skin of khen’s arm together and applied the bandage to her cut END_TOKEN
always use clean cloth you’ve boiled—rotspren love dirty cloth END_TOKEN
infection is the real danger here ; you’ll spot it as red along the outsides of the wound that grows and streaks END_TOKEN
always wash out a cut before binding it END_TOKEN
he patted khen’s arm and took back his knife , which had caused the offending laceration when khen had been using it to cut branches off a fallen tree for firewood END_TOKEN
around her , the other parshmen gathered the cakes they’d dried in the sun END_TOKEN
they had a surprising number of resources , all things considered END_TOKEN
several parshmen had thought to grab metal buckets during their raid— which had worked as pots for boiling—and the waterskins were going to be a lifesaver END_TOKEN
he joined sah , the parshman who had originally been his captor , among the trees of their improvised camp END_TOKEN
the parshman was lashing a stone axehead to a branch END_TOKEN
kaladin took it from him and tested it against a log , judging how well it split the wood END_TOKEN
you need to lash it tighter , kaladin said END_TOKEN
get the leather strips wet and really pull as you wrap it END_TOKEN
if you aren’t careful , it’ll fall off on you midswing END_TOKEN
sah grunted , taking back the hatchet and grumbling to himself as he undid the lashings END_TOKEN
you can go check on someone else , human END_TOKEN
we should march tonight , kaladin said END_TOKEN
we’ve been in one spot too long END_TOKEN
and break into small groups , like i said END_TOKEN
look , if there’s something wrong with my advice…
sah sighed , looking up and meeting kaladin’s eyes END_TOKEN
where did a slave learn to give orders and strut about like a lighteyes END_TOKEN
my entire life was not spent as a slave END_TOKEN
i hate , sah continued , feeling like a child END_TOKEN
he started rewrapping the axehead , tighter this time END_TOKEN
i hate being taught things that i should already know END_TOKEN
most of all , i hate needing your help END_TOKEN
you leap in , start telling us what to do END_TOKEN
we’re back to following alethi orders again END_TOKEN
that yellow spren isn’t any better , sah muttered END_TOKEN
she tells us we’re free , then with the very next breath berates us for not obeying quickly enough END_TOKEN
they were surprised that kaladin couldn’t see the spren END_TOKEN
they’d also mentioned to him the sounds they heard , distant rhythms , almost music END_TOKEN
‘freedom’ is a strange word , sah , kaladin said softly , settling down END_TOKEN
these last few months , i’ve probably been more ‘free’ than at any time since my childhood END_TOKEN
you want to know what i did with it END_TOKEN
i stayed in the same place , serving another highlord END_TOKEN
i wonder if men who use cords to bind are fools , since tradition , society , and momentum are going to tie us all down anyway END_TOKEN
i don’t have traditions , sah said END_TOKEN
but still , my ‘freedom’ is that of a leaf END_TOKEN
dropped from the tree , i just blow on the wind and pretend i’m in charge of my destiny END_TOKEN
that was almost poetry , sah END_TOKEN
i have no idea what that is END_TOKEN
he pulled the last lashing tight and held up the new hatchet END_TOKEN
kaladin took it and buried it into the log next to him END_TOKEN
teaching us to make cakes is one thing END_TOKEN
giving us weapons is quite another END_TOKEN
a hatchet is a tool , not a weapon END_TOKEN
but with this same chipping and sharpening method you taught , i will eventually make a spear END_TOKEN
you act as if a fight is inevitable END_TOKEN
says the man with the brand on his forehead END_TOKEN
if they’re willing to do that to one of their own , what brutality awaits a bunch of thieving parshmen END_TOKEN
sah , it doesn’t have to come to war END_TOKEN
you don’t have to fight the humans END_TOKEN
but let me ask you this END_TOKEN
he set the axe across his lap END_TOKEN
considering what they did to me , why wouldn’t i END_TOKEN
kaladin couldn’t force out an objection END_TOKEN
he remembered his own time as a slave : the frustration , powerlessness , anger END_TOKEN
they’d branded him with shash because he was dangerous END_TOKEN
dare he demand this man do otherwise END_TOKEN
they’ll want to enslave us again , sah continued , taking the hatchet and hacking at the log next to him , starting to strip off the rough bark as kaladin had instructed , so they could have tinder END_TOKEN
we’re money lost , and a dangerous precedent END_TOKEN
your kind will expend a fortune figuring out what changed to give us back our minds , and they’ll find a way to reverse it END_TOKEN
they’ll strip from me my sanity , and set me to carrying water again END_TOKEN
maybe… maybe we can convince them otherwise END_TOKEN
i know good men among the alethi lighteyes , sah END_TOKEN
if we talk to them , show them how you can talk and think—that you’re like regular people—they’ll listen END_TOKEN
they’ll agree to give you your freedom END_TOKEN
that’s how they treated your cousins on the shattered plains when they first met END_TOKEN
sah slammed the hatchet down into the wood , sending a chip fluttering into the air END_TOKEN
and that’s why we should be free now END_TOKEN
we deserved slavery before , when we were different END_TOKEN
it’s all right to dominate us when we won’t fight back , but now it’s not , because we can talk END_TOKEN
thank you for what you’re showing us , but don’t expect me to be happy that i need you for it END_TOKEN
this just reinforces the belief within you , maybe even within myself , that your people should be the ones who decide upon our freedom in the first place END_TOKEN
sah stalked off , and once he was gone , syl appeared from the underbrush and settled on kaladin’s shoulder , alert—watching for the voidspren—but not immediately alarmed END_TOKEN
i think i can sense a highstorm coming , she whispered END_TOKEN
i suppose i could have done this earlier , but i didn’t need to END_TOKEN
how to protect these people from the storm END_TOKEN
i can’t do this , syl , kaladin whispered END_TOKEN
i can’t spend time with these parshmen , see their side END_TOKEN
this is going to come to war END_TOKEN
the voidspren will drive the parshmen into an army , and rightly so , after what was done to them END_TOKEN
our kind will have to fight back or be destroyed END_TOKEN
middle ground only comes in war after lots of people have died—and only after the important people are worried they might actually lose END_TOKEN
storms , i shouldn’t be here END_TOKEN
i’m starting to want to defend these people END_TOKEN
i don’t dare—the only way i can fight the voidbringers is to pretend there’s a difference between the ones i have to protect and the ones i have to kill END_TOKEN
he trudged through the underbrush and started helping tear down one of the crude tarp tents for the night’s march END_TOKEN
i am no storyteller , to entertain you with whimsical yarns END_TOKEN
a clamorous , insistent knocking woke shallan END_TOKEN
she still didn’t have a bed , so she slept in a heap of red hair and twisted blankets END_TOKEN
she pulled one of these over her head , but the knocking persisted , followed by adolin’s annoyingly charming voice END_TOKEN
look , this time i’m going to wait to come in until you’re really sure i should END_TOKEN
she peeked out at the sunlight , which poured through her balcony window like spilled paint END_TOKEN
the sun was in the wrong place END_TOKEN
she’d spent the night out as veil , then slept to the afternoon END_TOKEN
she groaned , tossing off sweaty blankets , and lay there in just her shift , head pounding END_TOKEN
there was an empty jug of horneater white in the corner END_TOKEN
depends , she said , voice croaking , on the context END_TOKEN
she put hands over her eyes , safehand still wrapped in an improvised bandage END_TOKEN
tossing around the symbol of the ghostbloods END_TOKEN
stabbing a man in front of a gang of armed thugs END_TOKEN
her actions felt like they’d taken place in a dream END_TOKEN
shallan , adolin said , sounding concerned END_TOKEN
palona says you’ve been in here all day END_TOKEN
she yelped , sitting up and grabbing the bedding END_TOKEN
when he looked , he found her bundled there , a frizzy - haired head protruding from blankets— which she had pulled tight up to her chin END_TOKEN
he looked perfect , of course END_TOKEN
adolin could look perfect after a storm , six hours of fighting , and a bath in cremwater END_TOKEN
how did he make his hair so adorable END_TOKEN
messy in just the right way END_TOKEN
palona said you weren’t feeling well , adolin said , pushing aside the cloth door and leaning in the doorway END_TOKEN
is it , um , girl stuff END_TOKEN
girl stuff , she said flatly END_TOKEN
i’m aware of the biology , adolin , thank you END_TOKEN
why is it that every time a woman is feeling a little odd , men are so quick to blame her cycle END_TOKEN
as if she’s suddenly unable to control herself because she has some pains END_TOKEN
‘oh , stay away from venar today END_TOKEN
he sparred too much yesterday , so his muscles are sore , and he’s likely to rip your head off END_TOKEN
shallan blew a lock of it out of her eyes END_TOKEN
oblivious to our attempts to fix it END_TOKEN
the almighty gave us messy hair to prepare us for living with men END_TOKEN
adolin brought in a small pot of warm washwater for her face and hands END_TOKEN
and palona , who had probably sent it with him END_TOKEN
she remembered occasionally burning off the alcohol last night , but hadn’t ever held enough stormlight to completely fix the hand END_TOKEN
and never enough to make her completely sober END_TOKEN
adolin set the water down , perky as a sunrise , grinning END_TOKEN
she pulled the blanket up over her head and pulled it tight , like the hood of a cloak END_TOKEN
see , i don’t think men would blame your cycle nearly as much if you all didn’t do the same END_TOKEN
i’ve courted my share of women , and i once kept track END_TOKEN
deeli was once sick for womanly reasons four times in the same month END_TOKEN
he lifted up the jug and gave it a sniff END_TOKEN
he looked to her , seeming shocked—but perhaps also a little impressed END_TOKEN
got a little carried away , shallan grumbled END_TOKEN
in a place serving horneater moonshine END_TOKEN
adolin , dear , she said , finally pulling the blanket back down to her shoulders , i could literally survive being stabbed with a sword through the chest END_TOKEN
i think i’ll be fine with some ruffians in the market END_TOKEN
it’s kind of easy to forget END_TOKEN
you could survive all kinds of nasty murder , but you still…
i’m an all - powerful , shardblade - wielding pseudo - immortal , but nature still sends a friendly reminder every now and then to tell me i should be getting around to having children END_TOKEN
no mating , pattern buzzed softly on the wall END_TOKEN
but i shouldn’t be blaming yesterday on that , shallan added to adolin END_TOKEN
my time isn’t for another few weeks END_TOKEN
yesterday was more about psychology than it was about biology END_TOKEN
yeah , well , you might want to watch out for the horneater wines END_TOKEN
it’s not so bad , shallan said with a sigh END_TOKEN
i can burn away the intoxication with a little stormlight END_TOKEN
speaking of which , you don’t have any spheres with you , do you END_TOKEN
i seem to have… um… eaten all of mine END_TOKEN
father lent it to me so i could stop carrying a lantern everywhere in these halls END_TOKEN
she tried to bat her eyelashes at him END_TOKEN
she wasn’t exactly sure how one did that , or why , but it seemed to work END_TOKEN
at the very least , he rolled his eyes and handed over a single ruby mark END_TOKEN
she sucked in the light hungrily END_TOKEN
she held her breath so it wouldn’t puff out when she breathed , and… suppressed the light END_TOKEN
she could do that , she’d found END_TOKEN
to prevent herself from glowing or drawing attention END_TOKEN
she’d done that as a child , hadn’t she END_TOKEN
her hand slowly reknit , and she let out a relieved sigh as the headache vanished as well END_TOKEN
adolin was left with a dun sphere END_TOKEN
you know , when my father explained that good relationships required investment , i don’t think this is what he meant END_TOKEN
mmm , shallan said , closing her eyes and smiling END_TOKEN
also , adolin added , we have the strangest conversations END_TOKEN
it feels natural to have them with you , though END_TOKEN
i think that’s the oddest part END_TOKEN
well , you’ll want to start being more careful with your stormlight END_TOKEN
father mentioned he was trying to get you more infused spheres for practice , but there just aren’t any END_TOKEN
they left out lots of spheres in the last highstorm END_TOKEN
she did the math , and found herself stunned END_TOKEN
it had been weeks since the unexpected highstorm where she’d first worked the oathgate END_TOKEN
she looked at the sphere between adolin’s fingers END_TOKEN
those should all have gone dun by now , she thought END_TOKEN
even the ones renewed most recently END_TOKEN
how did they have any stormlight at all END_TOKEN
suddenly , her actions the night before seemed even more irresponsible END_TOKEN
when dalinar had commanded her to practice with her powers , he probably hadn’t meant practicing how to avoid getting too drunk END_TOKEN
she sighed , and—still keeping the blanket on—reached for the bowl of washing water END_TOKEN
she had a lady’s maid named marri , but she kept sending her away END_TOKEN
she didn’t want the woman discovering that she was sneaking out or changing faces END_TOKEN
if she kept on like that , palona would probably assign the woman to other work END_TOKEN
the water didn’t seem to have any scents or soaps applied to it , so shallan raised the small basin and then took a long , slurping drink END_TOKEN
i washed my feet in that , adolin noted END_TOKEN
anyway , thanks for dragging me out of bed END_TOKEN
well , he said , i have selfish reasons END_TOKEN
i’m kind of hoping for some moral support END_TOKEN
don’t hit the message too hard END_TOKEN
if you want someone to believe what you’re telling them , come to your point gradually , so they’re with you the entire time END_TOKEN
oh , not that kind of moral , shallan said END_TOKEN
talking to you can be weird sometimes END_TOKEN
she sat as primly and attentively as she could , wrapped in a blanket with her hair sticking out like the snarls of a thorn - bush END_TOKEN
my father finally persuaded ialai sadeas to speak with me END_TOKEN
father hopes she’ll have some clues about her husband’s death END_TOKEN
i don’t like her , shallan END_TOKEN
shallan opened her mouth , but he cut her off END_TOKEN
not strange like you , he said END_TOKEN
she’s always weighing everything and everyone she meets END_TOKEN
she’s never treated me as anything other than a child END_TOKEN
how much time do i have END_TOKEN
shallan looked down at herself , huddled in her blankets , frizzy hair tickling her chin END_TOKEN
then we’ll be late , adolin said , standing up END_TOKEN
it’s not like her opinion of me could get any worse END_TOKEN
meet me at sebarial’s sitting room END_TOKEN
father wants me to take some reports from him on commerce END_TOKEN
tell him the booze in the market is good END_TOKEN
adolin glanced again at the empty jug of horneater white , then shook his head and left END_TOKEN
an hour later , shallan presented herself—bathed , makeup done , hair somewhat under control—to sebarial’s sitting room END_TOKEN
the chamber was larger than her room , but notably , the doorway out onto the balcony was enormous , taking up half the wall END_TOKEN
everyone was out on the wide balcony , which overlooked the field below END_TOKEN
adolin stood by the railing , lost to some contemplation END_TOKEN
behind him , sebarial and palona lay on cots , their backs exposed to the sun , getting massages END_TOKEN
a flight of horneater servants massaged , tended coal braziers , or stood dutifully with warmed wine and other conveniences END_TOKEN
the air , particularly in the sun , wasn’t as chilly as it had been most other days END_TOKEN
shallan found herself caught between embarrassment—this plump , bearded man wearing only a towel was the highprince—and outrage END_TOKEN
she’d just taken a cold bath , pouring ladles of water on her own head while shivering END_TOKEN
she’d considered that a luxury , as she hadn’t been required to fetch the water herself END_TOKEN
how is it , shallan said , that i am still sleeping on the floor , while you have cots right here END_TOKEN
sebarial mumbled , not even opening his eyes END_TOKEN
i’m a knight radiant , which i should think is higher END_TOKEN
i see , he said , then groaned in pleasure at the masseuse’s touch , and so you can pay to have a cot carried in from the warcamps END_TOKEN
or do you still rely on the stipend i give you END_TOKEN
a stipend , i’ll add , that was supposed to pay for your help as a scribe for my accounts—something i haven’t seen in weeks END_TOKEN
she did save the world , turi , palona noted from shallan’s other side END_TOKEN
the middle - aged herdazian woman also hadn’t opened her eyes , and though she lay chest - down , her safehand was tucked only halfway under a towel END_TOKEN
see , i don’t think she saved it , so much as delayed its destruction END_TOKEN
it’s a mess out there , my dear END_TOKEN
nearby , the head masseuse—a large horneater woman with vibrant red hair and pale skin—ordered a round of heated stones for sebarial END_TOKEN
most of the servants were probably her family END_TOKEN
horneaters did like to be in business together END_TOKEN
i will note , sebarial said , that this desolation of yours is going to undermine years of my business planning END_TOKEN
you can’t possibly blame me for that , shallan said , folding her arms END_TOKEN
you did chase me out of the warcamps , sebarial said , even though they survived quite well END_TOKEN
the remnants of those domes shielded them from the west END_TOKEN
the big problem was the parshmen , but those have all cleared out now , marching toward alethkar END_TOKEN
so i plan to go back and reclaim my land there before others seize it END_TOKEN
he opened his eyes and glanced at shallan END_TOKEN
your young prince didn’t want to hear that—he worries i will stretch our forces too thin END_TOKEN
but those warcamps are going to be vital for trade ; we can’t leave them completely to thanadal and vamah END_TOKEN
no wonder adolin looked so distracted END_TOKEN
he’d noted they’d be late to visiting ialai , but didn’t seem particularly eager to be on the move END_TOKEN
you be a good radiant , sebarial told her , and get those other oathgates working END_TOKEN
i’ve prepared quite the scheme for taxing passage through them END_TOKEN
the only way to survive in these mountains will be to tax the oathgates , and dalinar knows it END_TOKEN
he put me in charge of commerce END_TOKEN
life doesn’t stop for a war , child END_TOKEN
everyone will still need new shoes , baskets , clothing , wine END_TOKEN
and we need massages , palona added END_TOKEN
lots of them , if we’re going to have to live in this frozen wasteland END_TOKEN
you two are hopeless , shallan snapped , walking across the sunlit balcony to adolin END_TOKEN
she and adolin struck out through the hallways END_TOKEN
each of the eight highprincedoms’ armies in residence at the tower had been granted a quarter of the second or third level , with a few barracks on the first level , leaving most of that level reserved for markets and storage END_TOKEN
of course , not even the first level had been completely explored END_TOKEN
there were so many hallways and bizarre tangents—hidden sets of rooms tucked away behind everything else END_TOKEN
maybe eventually each highprince would rule his quarter in earnest END_TOKEN
for now , they occupied little pockets of civilization within the dark frontier that was urithiru END_TOKEN
exploration on the upper levels had been completely halted , as they no longer had stormlight to spare in working the lifts END_TOKEN
they left sebarial’s quarter , passing soldiers and an intersection with painted arrows on the floor leading to various places , such as the nearest privy END_TOKEN
the guards’ checkpoint didn’t look like a barricade , but adolin had pointed out the boxes of rations , the bags of grain , set in a specific way before the soldiers END_TOKEN
anyone rushing this corridor from the outside would get tangled in all of that , plus face pikemen beyond END_TOKEN
the soldiers nodded to adolin , but didn’t salute him , though one did bark an order to two men playing cards in a nearby room END_TOKEN
the fellows stood up , and shallan was startled to recognize them END_TOKEN
thought we’d take your guards today , adolin said END_TOKEN
shallan had a group of soldiers made up of deserters and despicable murderers END_TOKEN
she didn’t mind that part , being a despicable murderer herself END_TOKEN
but she also had no idea what to do with them END_TOKEN
gaz , short with a single brown eye , the other socket covered by a patch END_TOKEN
adolin had obviously already briefed them , and vathah sauntered out to guard them in the front , while gaz lingered behind END_TOKEN
hoping they were far enough away not to hear , shallan took adolin by the arm END_TOKEN
shallan , being guarded isn’t always about safety END_TOKEN
prestige is practically leaking from my nose these days , adolin END_TOKEN
you don’t need guards , maybe , but you do need an honor guard END_TOKEN
men to be honored by their position END_TOKEN
it’s part of the rules we play by—you get to be someone important , and they get to share in it END_TOKEN
by being part of what you’re doing , adolin said END_TOKEN
storms , i forget how new you are to all this END_TOKEN
what have you been doing with these men END_TOKEN
what of when you need them END_TOKEN
i don’t know if i will END_TOKEN
maybe not their military commander , as they’re a civil guard , but it amounts to the same thing END_TOKEN
leave them idle , make them assume they’re inconsequential , and you’ll ruin them END_TOKEN
give them something important to do instead , work they’ll be proud of , and they’ll serve you with honor END_TOKEN
a failed soldier is often one that has been failed END_TOKEN
you sound like your father , she said END_TOKEN
he paused , then looked away END_TOKEN
i’ll find something to do with my guards , adolin END_TOKEN
gaz and vathah didn’t seem to think the duty was all that important , from the way they yawned and slouched as they walked , holding out oil lamps , spears at their shoulders END_TOKEN
they passed a large group of women carrying water , and then some men carrying lumber to set up a new privy END_TOKEN
most made way for vathah ; seeing a personal guard was a cue to step to the side END_TOKEN
of course , if shallan had really wanted to exude importance , she’d have taken a palanquin END_TOKEN
she didn’t mind the vehicles ; she’d used them extensively in kharbranth END_TOKEN
maybe it was the part of veil inside of her , though , that made her resist adolin whenever he suggested she order one END_TOKEN
there was an independence to using her own feet END_TOKEN
they reached the stairwell up , and at the top , adolin dug in his pocket for a map END_TOKEN
the painted arrows weren’t all finished up here END_TOKEN
shallan tugged his arm and pointed the way down a tunnel END_TOKEN
how can you know that so easily END_TOKEN
don’t you see how wide those strata are END_TOKEN
she asked , pointing to the wall of the corridor END_TOKEN
he tucked away his map and gestured for vathah to lead the way END_TOKEN
do you really think i’m like my father END_TOKEN
adolin said softly as they walked END_TOKEN
there was a worried sense to his voice END_TOKEN
you are , she said , pulling his arm tight END_TOKEN
you’re just like him , adolin END_TOKEN
moral , just , and capable END_TOKEN
you’re worried you can’t live up to his expectations , aren’t you END_TOKEN
you have lived up to them in every way END_TOKEN
i’m certain dalinar kholin couldn’t hope for a better son , and… storms END_TOKEN
shallan poked adolin in the shoulder with her freehand END_TOKEN
well , thank the almighty for that END_TOKEN
not… going to ask what it is END_TOKEN
a relationship needs some measure of mystery END_TOKEN
adolin fell silent , which was all well and good , because they were approaching the sadeas section of urithiru END_TOKEN
though ialai had threatened to relocate back to the warcamps , she’d made no such move END_TOKEN
likely because there was no denying that this city was now the seat of alethi politics and power END_TOKEN
they reached the first guard post , and shallan’s two guards pulled up close to her and adolin END_TOKEN
they exchanged hostile glares with the soldiers in forest - green - and - white uniforms as they were allowed past END_TOKEN
whatever ialai sadeas thought , her men had obviously made up their minds END_TOKEN
it was strange how much difference a few steps could make END_TOKEN
in here , they passed far fewer workers or merchants , and far more soldiers END_TOKEN
men with dark expressions , unbuttoned coats , and unshaved faces of all varieties END_TOKEN
even the scribes were diff rent—more makeup , but sloppier clothing END_TOKEN
it felt like they’d stepped from law into disorder END_TOKEN
loud voices echoed down hallways , laughing raucously END_TOKEN
the stripes painted to guide the way were on the walls here rather than the floor , and the paint had been allowed to drip , spoiling the strata END_TOKEN
they’d been smeared in places by men who had walked by , their coats brushing the still - wet paint END_TOKEN
the soldiers they passed all sneered at adolin END_TOKEN
they feel like gangs , shallan said softly , looking over her shoulder at one group END_TOKEN
don’t mistake them , adolin said END_TOKEN
they march in step , their boots are sturdy , and their weapons well maintained END_TOKEN
it’s just that where father used discipline , sadeas used competition END_TOKEN
besides , here , looking too clean will get you mocked END_TOKEN
you can’t be mistaken for a kholin END_TOKEN
she’d hoped that maybe , now that the truth about the desolation had been revealed , dalinar would have an easier time of uniting the highprinces END_TOKEN
well , that obviously wasn’t going to happen while these men blamed dalinar for sadeas’s death END_TOKEN
they eventually reached the proper rooms and were ushered in to confront sadeas’s wife END_TOKEN
ialai was a short woman with thick lips and green eyes END_TOKEN
she sat in a throne at the center of the room END_TOKEN
standing beside her was mraize , one of the leaders of the ghostbloods END_TOKEN
i am no philosopher , to intrigue you with piercing questions END_TOKEN
his face was crisscrossed by scars , one of which deformed his upper lip END_TOKEN
instead of his usual fashionable clothing , today he wore a sadeas uniform , with a breastplate and a simple skullcap helm END_TOKEN
he looked exactly like the other soldiers they’d passed , save for that face END_TOKEN
and the chicken on his shoulder END_TOKEN
it was one of the stranger varieties , pure green and sleek , with a wicked beak END_TOKEN
it looked much more like a predator than the bumbling things she’d seen sold in cages at markets END_TOKEN
who walked around with a pet chicken END_TOKEN
they were for eating , right END_TOKEN
adolin noted the chicken and raised an eyebrow , but mraize didn’t give any sign that he knew shallan END_TOKEN
he slouched like the other soldiers , holding a halberd and glaring at adolin END_TOKEN
ialai hadn’t set out chairs for them END_TOKEN
she sat with her hands in her lap , sleeved safehand beneath her freehand , lit by lamps on pedestals at either side of the room END_TOKEN
she looked particularly vengeful by that unnatural flickering light END_TOKEN
did you know , ialai said , that after whitespines make a kill , they will eat , then hide near the carcass END_TOKEN
it’s one of the dangers in hunting them , brightness , adolin said END_TOKEN
you assume that you’re on the beast’s trail , but it might be lurking nearby END_TOKEN
i used to wonder at this behavior until i realized the kill will attract scavengers , and the whitespine is not picky END_TOKEN
the ones that come to feast on its leavings become another meal themselves END_TOKEN
the implication of the conversation seemed clear to shallan END_TOKEN
why have you returned to the scene of the kill , kholin END_TOKEN
we want you to know , brightness , adolin said , that we take the murder of a highprince very seriously END_TOKEN
we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again END_TOKEN
of course you are , ialai said END_TOKEN
the other highprinces are now too afraid to stand up to you END_TOKEN
yes , he’d walked right into that one END_TOKEN
but shallan didn’t take over ; this was adolin’s task , and he’d invited her for support , not to speak for him END_TOKEN
honestly , she wouldn’t be doing much better END_TOKEN
she’d just be making diff rent mistakes END_TOKEN
can you tell us of anyone who might have had the opportunity and motive for killing your husband END_TOKEN
other than my father , brightness END_TOKEN
my mother always said she thought you were clever END_TOKEN
she admired you , and wished she had your wit END_TOKEN
yet here , i see no proof of that END_TOKEN
honestly , do you really think that my father would withstand sadeas’s insults for years—weather his betrayal on the plains , suffer that dueling fiasco—only to assassinate him now END_TOKEN
once sadeas was proven wrong about the voidbringers , and my father’s position is secure END_TOKEN
we both know my father wasn’t behind your husband’s death END_TOKEN
to claim otherwise is simple idiocy END_TOKEN
she hadn’t expected that from adolin’s lips END_TOKEN
strikingly , it seemed to her to be the precise thing he’d needed to say END_TOKEN
deliver the straight and earnest truth END_TOKEN
ialai leaned forward , inspecting adolin and chewing on his words END_TOKEN
if there was one thing adolin could convey , it was authenticity END_TOKEN
fetch him a chair , ialai said to mraize END_TOKEN
yes , brightness , he said , his voice thick with a rural accent that bordered on herdazian END_TOKEN
there are teas warming in the side room END_TOKEN
she was no longer some inconsequential ward , to be ordered about END_TOKEN
however , mraize lurched off in the same direction she’d been told to go , so shallan bore the indignity and stalked after him END_TOKEN
the next room was much smaller , cut out of the same stone as the others , but with a muted pattern of strata END_TOKEN
oranges and reds that blended together so evenly you could almost pretend the wall was all one hue END_TOKEN
ialai’s people had been using it for storage , as evidenced by the chairs in one corner END_TOKEN
shallan ignored the warm jugs of tea heating on fabrials on the counter and stepped close to mraize END_TOKEN
his chicken chirped softly , as if in agitation END_TOKEN
i’m keeping an eye on that one , he said , nodding toward the other room END_TOKEN
here , his voice became refined , losing the rural edge END_TOKEN
so she’s not one of you END_TOKEN
no , he said , eyes narrowing END_TOKEN
she and her husband were too wild a variable for us to invite END_TOKEN
their motives are their own ; i don’t think they align to those of anyone else , human or listener END_TOKEN
the fact that they’re crem didn’t enter into it , i suppose END_TOKEN
morality is an axis that doesn’t interest us , mraize said calmly END_TOKEN
only loyalty and power are relevant , for morality is as ephemeral as the changing weather END_TOKEN
it depends upon the angle from which you view it END_TOKEN
you will see , as you work with us , that i am right END_TOKEN
i’m not one of you , shallan hissed END_TOKEN
for one so insistent , mraize said , picking up a chair , you were certainly free in using our symbol last night END_TOKEN
shallan froze , then blushed furiously END_TOKEN
your hunt is worthy , mraize said END_TOKEN
and you are allowed to rely upon our authority to achieve your goals END_TOKEN
that is a benefit of your membership , so long as you do not abuse it END_TOKEN
you promised to deliver them to me END_TOKEN
it has been but a few weeks since we rescued them END_TOKEN
you will see my word fulfilled in that matter END_TOKEN
regardless , i have a task for you END_TOKEN
shallan snapped , causing the chicken to chirp at her again END_TOKEN
mraize , i’m not going to do some task for you people END_TOKEN
an enemy combatant , mraize said END_TOKEN
oh , don’t look at me like that END_TOKEN
you know full well what that woman was capable of , and what she got herself into by attacking us END_TOKEN
do you blame your wonderfully moral blackthorn for what he did in war END_TOKEN
don’t deflect your evils by pointing out the faults of others , shallan said END_TOKEN
i’m not going to further your cause END_TOKEN
i don’t care how much you demand that i soulcast for you , i’m not going to do it END_TOKEN
so quick to insist , yet you acknowledge your debt END_TOKEN
but we forgive these things , for missions undertaken END_TOKEN
and before you object again , know that the task we require of you is one you’re already undertaking END_TOKEN
surely you have sensed the darkness in this place END_TOKEN
shallan looked about the small room , flickering with shadows from a few candles on the counter END_TOKEN
your task , mraize said , is to secure this location END_TOKEN
urithiru must remain strong if we are to properly use the advent of the voidbringers END_TOKEN
this is a power we will control , but we must not let either side gain dominance yet END_TOKEN
hunt the source of the darkness you feel , and expunge it END_TOKEN
and for it i will give payment in information END_TOKEN
he leaned closer to her and spoke a single word END_TOKEN
he lifted the chair and walked out , adopting a more bumbling gait , stumbling and almost dropping the chair END_TOKEN
her eldest brother had died in alethkar—where he’d been for mysterious reasons END_TOKEN
storms , what did mraize know END_TOKEN
she glared after him , outraged END_TOKEN
how dare he tease with that name END_TOKEN
don’t focus on helaran right now END_TOKEN
those were dangerous thoughts , and she could not become veil now END_TOKEN
shallan poured herself and adolin cups of tea , then grabbed a chair under her arm and awkwardly navigated back out END_TOKEN
she sat down beside adolin , then handed him a cup END_TOKEN
she took a sip and smiled at ialai , who glared at her , then directed mraize to fetch a cup END_TOKEN
i think , ialai said to adolin , that if you honestly wish to solve this crime , you won’t be looking at my husband’s former enemies END_TOKEN
nobody had the opportunity or motives that you would find in your warcamp END_TOKEN
i’m not saying dalinar did this , ialai said END_TOKEN
she seemed calm , but she gripped the sides of her chair with white - knuckled hands END_TOKEN
and her eyes… makeup could not hide the redness END_TOKEN
i could fake crying , shallan thought , if i knew that someone was coming to see me , and if i believed the act would strengthen my position END_TOKEN
history is rife with examples of soldiers assuming orders when there were none , ialai said END_TOKEN
i agree that dalinar would never knife an old friend in dark quarters END_TOKEN
his soldiers may not be so inhibited END_TOKEN
you want to know who did this , adolin kholin END_TOKEN
i would wager the princedom that somewhere in the kholin army is a man who thought to do his highprince a service END_TOKEN
i do not know the mind of this person , ialai said END_TOKEN
maybe they have a taste for it now END_TOKEN
in any case , i think we can agree this meeting serves no further purpose END_TOKEN
i hope you will share what you discover with me , so that my own investigator can be better informed END_TOKEN
i suppose , adolin said , standing END_TOKEN
he is among my husband’s most acclaimed generals END_TOKEN
she glanced at mraize , who kept his expression neutral END_TOKEN
storms , what did he know END_TOKEN
she still didn’t understand where helaran had gotten his shardblade END_TOKEN
what had led him to clash with amaram in the first place END_TOKEN
he arrived with the last caravan and scavenging crew that you brought through the oathgate END_TOKEN
he didn’t make himself known to the tower , but to me alone END_TOKEN
we have been seeing to his needs , as he was caught out in a storm with his attendants END_TOKEN
he assures me he will return to duty soon , and will make finding my husband’s murderer a priority END_TOKEN
he looked to shallan , and she nodded , still stunned END_TOKEN
together they collected her soldiers from right inside the door , and left into the hallway beyond END_TOKEN
bridgeboy isn’t going to be happy about this END_TOKEN
they have a vendetta , those two END_TOKEN
father originally appointed amaram to refound the knights radiant , adolin continued END_TOKEN
if ialai has taken him in after he was so soundly discredited… the mere act of it calls father a liar , doesn’t it END_TOKEN
she shook herself and took a deep breath END_TOKEN
she would worry about getting answers from mraize later END_TOKEN
it depends on how she spins things , she said softly , walking beside adolin END_TOKEN
but yes , she implies that dalinar is at the least overly judgmental in his treatment of amaram END_TOKEN
she’s reinforcing her side as an alternative to your father’s rule END_TOKEN
i’d have thought that without sadeas , maybe it would get easier END_TOKEN
politics is involved , adolin—so by definition it can’t be easy END_TOKEN
she took his arm , wrapping hers around it as they passed another group of hostile guards END_TOKEN
i’m terrible at this , adolin said softly END_TOKEN
i got so annoyed in there , i almost punched her END_TOKEN
because i think you’re right about there being multiple killers END_TOKEN
i heard some things while i was out last night END_TOKEN
when you weren’t staggering around drunk , you mean END_TOKEN
i’ll have you know i’m a very graceful drunk , adolin kholin END_TOKEN
let’s go… she trailed off as a pair of scribes ran past in the hallway , heading toward ialai’s rooms at a shocking speed END_TOKEN
adolin caught one by the arm , nearly provoking a fight as the man cursed at the blue uniform END_TOKEN
the fellow , fortunately , recognized adolin’s face and held himself back , hand moving off the axe in a sling to his side END_TOKEN
brightlord , the man said , reluctant END_TOKEN
why is everyone suddenly talking at that guard post farther along END_TOKEN
news from the coast , the guard finally said END_TOKEN
i am no poet , to delight you with clever allusions END_TOKEN
i don’t got any meat to sell , the old lighteyes said as he led kaladin into the storm bunker END_TOKEN
but your brightlord and his men can weather in here , and for cheap END_TOKEN
he waved his cane toward the large hollow building END_TOKEN
it reminded kaladin of the barracks on the shattered plains—long and narrow , with one small end pointed eastward END_TOKEN
we’ll need it to ourselves , kaladin said END_TOKEN
the elderly man glanced at kaladin , taking in the blue uniform END_TOKEN
now that the weeping had passed , it looked better END_TOKEN
he wouldn’t wear it to an officer’s review , but he’d spent some good time scrubbing out the stains and polishing the buttons END_TOKEN
it could imply a host of things END_TOKEN
hopefully one of them was not this kholin offi er has joined a bunch of runaway parshmen END_TOKEN
i can give you the whole bunker , the merchant said END_TOKEN
was supposed to be renting it to some caravans out of revolar , but they didn’t show END_TOKEN
but it’s storming strange , i’d say END_TOKEN
three caravans , with different masters and goods , all gone silent END_TOKEN
not even a runner to give me word END_TOKEN
glad i took ten percent up front END_TOKEN
it was vamah’s seat , the largest city between here and kholinar END_TOKEN
we’ll take the bunker , kaladin said , handing over some dun spheres END_TOKEN
and whatever food you can spare END_TOKEN
not much , by an army’s scale END_TOKEN
maybe a sack of longroots or two END_TOKEN
was expectin’ one of those caravans to resupply me END_TOKEN
he shook his head , expression distant END_TOKEN
you reckon it will keep coming back END_TOKEN
the everstorm had hit again the day before , its second occurrence—not counting the initial one that had only come in the far east END_TOKEN
kaladin and the parshmen had weathered this one , upon warning from the unseen spren , in an abandoned mine END_TOKEN
strange times , the old man said again END_TOKEN
well , if you do need meat , there’s been a nest of wild hogs rooting about in the ravine to the south of here END_TOKEN
this is highlord cadilar’s land though , so um END_TOKEN
… well , you just understand that END_TOKEN
if kaladin’s fictional brightlord was traveling on the king’s orders , they could hunt the lands END_TOKEN
if not , killing another highlord’s hogs would be poaching END_TOKEN
the old man spoke like a backwater farmer , light yellow eyes notwithstanding , but he’d obviously made something of himself running a waystop END_TOKEN
a lonely life , but the money was probably quite good END_TOKEN
let’s see what food i can find you here , the old man said END_TOKEN
now , you’re sure a storm is coming END_TOKEN
well , bless the almighty and heralds for that , i suppose END_TOKEN
will catch some people surprised , but it will be nice to be able to work my spanreed again END_TOKEN
kaladin followed the man to a stone rootshed on the leeward edge of his home , and haggled—briefly—for three sacks of vegetables END_TOKEN
one other thing , kaladin added END_TOKEN
you can’t watch the army arrive END_TOKEN
corporal , it’s my duty to see your people settled in—
my brightlord is a very private person END_TOKEN
it’s important nobody know of our passing END_TOKEN
he laid his hand on his belt knife END_TOKEN
i can be trusted to hold my tongue , soldier END_TOKEN
he raised his chin , but when he hobbled back into his house , he shut the door tight and pulled closed the stormshutters END_TOKEN
kaladin transferred the three sacks into the bunker , then hiked out to where he’d left the parshmen END_TOKEN
he kept glancing about for syl , but of course he saw nothing END_TOKEN
the voidspren was following him , hidden , likely to make sure he didn’t do anything underhanded END_TOKEN
they made it back right before the storm END_TOKEN
khen , sah , and the others had wanted to wait until dark—unwilling to trust that the old lighteyes wouldn’t spy on them END_TOKEN
but the wind had started blowing , and they’d finally believed kaladin that a storm was imminent END_TOKEN
kaladin stood by the bunker’s doorway , anxious as the parshmen piled in END_TOKEN
they’d picked up other groups in the last few days , led by unseen voidspren that he was told darted away once their charges were delivered END_TOKEN
their numbers were now verging on a hundred , including the children and elderly END_TOKEN
nobody would tell kaladin their end goal , only that the spren had a destination in mind END_TOKEN
khen was last through the door ; the large , muscled parshwoman lingered , as if she wanted to watch the storm END_TOKEN
finally she took their spheres— most of which they’d stolen from him—and locked the sack into the iron - banded lantern on the wall outside END_TOKEN
she waved kaladin through the door , then followed , barring it closed END_TOKEN
you did well , human , she said to kaladin END_TOKEN
i’ll speak for you when we reach the gathering END_TOKEN
outside , the stormwall hit the bunker , making the stones shake and the very ground rattle END_TOKEN
the parshmen settled down to wait END_TOKEN
hesh dug into the sacks and inspected the vegetables with a critical eye END_TOKEN
she’d worked the kitchens of a manor END_TOKEN
kaladin settled with his back to the wall , feeling the storm rage outside END_TOKEN
strange , how he could hate the mild weeping so much , yet feel a thrill when he heard thunder beyond these stones END_TOKEN
that storm had tried its best to kill him on several occasions END_TOKEN
he felt a kinship to it—but still a wariness END_TOKEN
it was a sergeant who was too brutal in training his recruits END_TOKEN
the storm would renew the gems outside , which included not only spheres , but the larger gemstones he’d been carrying END_TOKEN
once renewed , he— well , the parshmen—would have a wealth of stormlight END_TOKEN
he needed to make a decision END_TOKEN
how long could he delay flying back to the shattered plains END_TOKEN
even if he had to stop at a larger city to trade his dun spheres for infused ones , he could probably make it in under a day END_TOKEN
what were they doing at urithiru END_TOKEN
what was the word from the rest of the world END_TOKEN
once , he had been happy to worry only about his own squad END_TOKEN
after that , he’d been willing to look after a battalion END_TOKEN
since when had the state of the entire world become his concern END_TOKEN
i need to steal back my spanreed at the very least , and send a message to brightness navani END_TOKEN
something flickered at the edge of his vision END_TOKEN
he glanced toward her , a question on his lips , and barely stopped the words as he realized his error END_TOKEN
the spren beside him was glowing yellow , not blue - white END_TOKEN
the tiny woman stood on a translucent pillar of golden stone that had risen from the ground to put her even with kaladin’s gaze END_TOKEN
it , like the spren herself , was the yellow - white color of the center of a flame END_TOKEN
she wore a flowing dress that covered her legs entirely END_TOKEN
hands behind her back , she inspected him END_TOKEN
her face was shaped oddly—narrow , but with large , childlike eyes END_TOKEN
kaladin jumped , which caused the little spren to smile END_TOKEN
pretend you don’t know anything about spren like her , kaladin thought END_TOKEN
because i want you to , she said END_TOKEN
why… why do you want me to see you END_TOKEN
she started to stroll around him , and at each step , a spike of yellow stone shot up from the ground and met her bare foot END_TOKEN
why are you still here , human END_TOKEN
your mother teach you to lie like that END_TOKEN
they’re less than a month old END_TOKEN
she stopped and smiled at him END_TOKEN
i’m a tad older than a month END_TOKEN
the world is changing , kaladin said END_TOKEN
i guess i want to see where this goes END_TOKEN
fortunately , he had a good excuse for the bead of sweat that trickled down the side of his face END_TOKEN
facing a strangely intelligent , glowing yellow spren would unnerve anyone , not just a man with too many things to hide END_TOKEN
would you fight for us , deserter END_TOKEN
my kind aren’t nearly as inclined toward discrimination as yours END_TOKEN
if you can carry a spear and take orders , then i certainly wouldn’t turn you away END_TOKEN
she folded her arms , smiling in a strangely knowing way END_TOKEN
the final decision won’t be mine END_TOKEN
where can i find out for certain END_TOKEN
close enough , the spren said END_TOKEN
off for a beard trim perhaps , or a lunch date with your grandmother END_TOKEN
he’d almost been able to forget about the hairs that prickled at the sides of his mouth END_TOKEN
tell me , the spren asked , how did you know that there would be a highstorm tonight END_TOKEN
felt it , kaladin said , in my bones END_TOKEN
humans cannot feel storms , regardless of the body part in question END_TOKEN
seemed like the right time for one , with the weeping having stopped and all END_TOKEN
she didn’t nod or give any visible sign of what she thought of that comment END_TOKEN
she merely held her knowing smile , then faded from his view END_TOKEN
i have no doubt that you are smarter than i am END_TOKEN
i can only relate what happened , what i have done , and then let you draw conclusions END_TOKEN
she’d been tall and willowy , with pale yellow hair—not true golden , like the hair of the iriali , but striking in its own right END_TOKEN
shy , both she and her brother , for all that they’d been willing to flee their homeland in an act of courage END_TOKEN
that was all that had emerged over the last few days END_TOKEN
the rest was still a blur END_TOKEN
he could recall meeting evi , courting her—awkwardly , since both knew it was an arrangement of political necessity—and eventually entering into a causal betrothal END_TOKEN
he didn’t remember love , but he did remember attraction END_TOKEN
the memories brought questions , like cremlings emerging from their hollows after the rain END_TOKEN
he ignored them , standing straight - backed with a line of guards on the field in front of urithiru , suffering a bitter wind from the west END_TOKEN
this wide plateau held some dumps of wood , as part of this space would probably end up becoming a lumberyard END_TOKEN
behind him , the end of a rope blew in the wind , smacking a pile of wood again and again END_TOKEN
a pair of windspren danced past , in the shapes of little people END_TOKEN
why am i remembering evi now END_TOKEN
and why have i recovered only my first memories of our time together END_TOKEN
he had always remembered the difficult years following evi’s death , which had culminated in his being drunk and useless on the night szeth , the assassin in white , had killed his brother END_TOKEN
he assumed that he’d gone to the nightwatcher to be rid of the pain at losing her , and the spren had taken his other memories as payment END_TOKEN
he didn’t know for certain , but that seemed right END_TOKEN
bargains with the nightwatcher were supposed to be permanent END_TOKEN
so what was happening to him END_TOKEN
dalinar glanced at his bracer clocks , strapped to his forearm END_TOKEN
he’d been wearing the thing barely a few days , and already he was counting minutes like a scribe END_TOKEN
the second of the two watch faces—which would count down to the next highstorm—still hadn’t been engaged END_TOKEN
a single highstorm had come , blessedly , carrying stormlight to renew spheres END_TOKEN
it seemed like so long since they’d had enough of that END_TOKEN
however , it would take until the next highstorm for the scribes to make guesses at the current pattern END_TOKEN
even then they could be wrong , as the weeping had lasted far longer than it should have END_TOKEN
centuries—millennia— of careful records might now be obsolete END_TOKEN
once , that alone would have been a catastrophe END_TOKEN
it threatened to ruin planting seasons and cause famines , to upend travel and shipping , disrupting trade END_TOKEN
unfortunately , in the face of the everstorm and the voidbringers , it was barely third on the list of cataclysms END_TOKEN
the cold wind blew at him again END_TOKEN
before them , the grand plateau of urithiru was ringed by ten large platforms , each raised about ten feet high , with steps up beside a ramp for carts END_TOKEN
at the center of each one was a small building containing the device that—
with a bright flash , an expanding wave of stormlight spread outward from the center of the second platform from the left END_TOKEN
when the light faded , dalinar led his troop of honor guards up the wide steps to the top END_TOKEN
they crossed to the building at the center , where a small group of people had stepped out and were now gawking at urithiru , surrounded by awespren END_TOKEN
the sight of a tower as wide as a city and as tall as a small mountain… well , there wasn’t anything else like it in the world END_TOKEN
at the head of the newcomers was a man in burnt orange robes END_TOKEN
aged , with a kindly , clean - shaven face , he stood with his head tipped back and jaw lowered as he regarded the city END_TOKEN
near him stood a woman with silvery hair pulled up in a bun END_TOKEN
adrotagia , the head kharbranthian scribe END_TOKEN
some thought she was the true power behind the throne ; others guessed it was that other scribe , the one they had left running kharbranth in its king’s absence END_TOKEN
whoever it was , they kept taravangian as a figurehead— and dalinar was happy to work through him to get to jah keved and kharbranth END_TOKEN
this man had been a friend to gavilar ; that was good enough for dalinar END_TOKEN
and he was more than glad to have at least one other monarch at urithiru END_TOKEN
taravangian smiled at dalinar , then licked his lips END_TOKEN
he seemed to have forgotten what he wanted to say , and had to glance at the woman beside him for support END_TOKEN
she whispered , and he spoke loudly after the reminder END_TOKEN
it is an honor to meet you again END_TOKEN
thank you so much for responding to my call END_TOKEN
dalinar had met taravangian several times , years ago END_TOKEN
he remembered a man of quiet , keen intelligence END_TOKEN
taravangian had always been humble , and had kept to himself , so most didn’t know he’d been intelligent once—before his strange illness five years ago , which navani was fairly certain covered an apoplexy that had permanently wounded his mental capacities END_TOKEN
adrotagia touched taravangian’s arm and nodded toward someone standing with the kharbranthian guards : a middle - aged lighteyed woman wearing a skirt and blouse , after a southern style , with the top buttons of the blouse undone END_TOKEN
her hair was short in a boyish cut , and she wore gloves on both hands END_TOKEN
the strange woman stretched her right hand over her head , and a shardblade appeared in it END_TOKEN
she rested it with the flat side against her shoulder END_TOKEN
blackthorn , this is the newest knight radiant END_TOKEN
king taravangian gawked like a child as they rode the lift toward the top of the tower END_TOKEN
he leaned over the side far enough that his large thaylen bodyguard rested a careful hand on the king’s shoulder , just in case END_TOKEN
so many levels , taravangian said END_TOKEN
dalinar had been around alethi politicians so much that he found honesty an obscure thing , like a language he no longer spoke END_TOKEN
my engineers are still studying the lifts , dalinar said END_TOKEN
it has to do with conjoined fabrials , they believe , with gears to modulate speed END_TOKEN
we had parshmen do ours , back in kharbranth END_TOKEN
we had to replace the gemstones with infused ones to make it work END_TOKEN
he shook his head , grinning END_TOKEN
in alethkar , this man would never have been able to hold a throne after the apoplexy struck him END_TOKEN
an unscrupulous family would have removed him by assassination END_TOKEN
in other families , someone would have challenged him for his throne END_TOKEN
he’d have been forced to fight or abdicate END_TOKEN
or… well , someone might have muscled him out of power , and acted like king in all but name END_TOKEN
dalinar sighed softly , but kept a firm grip on his guilt END_TOKEN
in kharbranth—which didn’t wage war—a mild , congenial figurehead made more sense END_TOKEN
the city was supposed to be unassuming , unthreatening END_TOKEN
it was a twist of luck that taravangian had also been crowned king of jah keved , once one of the most powerful kingdoms on roshar , following its civil war END_TOKEN
he would normally have had trouble keeping that throne , but perhaps dalinar might lend him some support—or at least authority—through association END_TOKEN
dalinar certainly intended to do everything he could END_TOKEN
your majesty , dalinar said , stepping closer to taravangian END_TOKEN
i have a great number of troops with too much idle time END_TOKEN
i could easily spare a battalion or two to help secure the city END_TOKEN
we can’t afford to lose the oathgate to the enemy END_TOKEN
the city is secure , brightlord END_TOKEN
the parshmen made one push for the city , but there are still many veden troops available END_TOKEN
we fended the enemy off , and they withdrew eastward END_TOKEN
taravangian again looked out into the wide central column , lit from the sheer glass window to the east END_TOKEN
ah , how i wish this day hadn’t come END_TOKEN
you sound as if you anticipated it , your majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i try not to hasten my expectations in either direction , dalinar said END_TOKEN
deal with today’s problems , then sleep and deal with tomorrow’s problems tomorrow END_TOKEN
i remember , as a child , listening to an ardent pray to the almighty on my behalf as glyphwards burned nearby END_TOKEN
i remember thinking… surely the sorrows can’t be past us END_TOKEN
surely the evils didn’t actually end END_TOKEN
if they had , wouldn’t we be back in the tranquiline halls even now END_TOKEN
he looked toward dalinar , and surprisingly there were tears in his pale grey eyes END_TOKEN
i do not think you and i are destined for such a glorious place END_TOKEN
men of blood and sorrow don’t get an ending like that , dalinar kholin END_TOKEN
dalinar found himself without a reply END_TOKEN
adrotagia gripped taravangian on the forearm with a comforting gesture , and the old king turned away , hiding his emotional outburst END_TOKEN
what had happened in vedenar must have troubled him deeply—the death of the previous king , the field of slaughter END_TOKEN
they rode the rest of the way in silence , and dalinar took the chance to study taravangian’s surgebinder END_TOKEN
she’d been the one to unlock—then activate—the veden oathgate on the other side , which she’d managed after some careful instructions from navani END_TOKEN
now the woman , malata , leaned idly against the side of the balcony END_TOKEN
she hadn’t spoken much during their tour of the first three levels , and when she looked at dalinar , she always seemed to have a hint of a smile on her lips END_TOKEN
she carried a wealth of spheres in her skirt pocket ; the light shone through the fabric END_TOKEN
perhaps that was why she smiled END_TOKEN
he himself felt relieved to have light at his fingertips again—and not only because it meant the alethi soulcasters could get back to work , using their emeralds to transform rock to grain to feed the hungry people of the tower END_TOKEN
navani met them at the top level , immaculate in an ornate silver and black havah , her hair in a bun and stabbed through with hairspikes meant to resemble shardblades END_TOKEN
she greeted taravangian warmly , then clasped hands with adrotagia END_TOKEN
after a greeting , navani stepped back and let teshav guide taravangian and his little retinue into what they were calling the initiation room END_TOKEN
navani herself drew dalinar to the side END_TOKEN
he’s as sincere as ever , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
this man has become an idiot END_TOKEN
you’re not dense , dalinar , she said END_TOKEN
i’ve no illusions as to the thickness of my skull , gemheart END_TOKEN
it’s done right by me on more than one occasion—better a thick head than a broken one END_TOKEN
but i don’t know that taravangian in his current state will be of much use END_TOKEN
we’ve more than enough clever people around us , dalinar END_TOKEN
taravangian was always a friend to alethkar during your brother’s reign , and a little illness shouldn’t change our treatment of him END_TOKEN
… he trailed off there’s an earnestness to him , navani END_TOKEN
and a melancholy i hadn’t remembered END_TOKEN
she checked her own arm clock , like his own , though with a few more gemstones attached END_TOKEN
some kind of new fabrial she was tinkering with END_TOKEN
it had been days since his last check - in , but he’d likely run out of infused rubies END_TOKEN
now that the highstorms had returned , they’d expected something END_TOKEN
in the room , teshav gestured to the various pillars , each representing an order of knight radiant END_TOKEN
dalinar and navani waited in the doorway , separated from the rest END_TOKEN
dustbringer , though they don’t like the term END_TOKEN
she claims her spren told her that END_TOKEN
i don’t like how she smiles END_TOKEN
if she’s truly a radiant , navani said , can she be anything but trustworthy END_TOKEN
would the spren pick someone who would act against the best interests of the orders END_TOKEN
another question he didn’t know the answer to END_TOKEN
he’d need to see if he could determine whether her shardblade was only that , or if it might be another honorblade in disguise END_TOKEN
the touring group moved down a set of steps toward the meeting chamber , which took up most of the penultimate level and sloped down to the level below END_TOKEN
dalinar and navani trailed after them END_TOKEN
it still gave him a heady , surreal feeling END_TOKEN
dreamlike , as if this were one of his visions END_TOKEN
he could vividly remember desiring her END_TOKEN
thinking about her , captivated by the way she talked , the things she knew , the look of her hands as she sketched—or , storms , as she did something as simple as raising a spoon to her lips END_TOKEN
he remembered a specific day on a battlefield , when he had almost let his jealousy of his brother lead him too far—and was surprised to feel evi slipping into that memory END_TOKEN
her presence colored the old , crusty memory of those war days with his brother END_TOKEN
my memories continue to return , he said softly as they paused at the door into the conference room END_TOKEN
i can only assume that eventually it will all come back END_TOKEN
but really , who can say END_TOKEN
the old magic is said to be inscrutable END_TOKEN
no , navani said , folding her arms , getting a stern expression on her face—as if angry with a stubborn child END_TOKEN
in each case i’ve looked into , the boon and curse both lasted until death END_TOKEN
about three hundred at this point , navani said END_TOKEN
it’s been difficult to get any time from the researchers at the palanaeum ; everyone the world over is demanding research into the voidbringers END_TOKEN
fortunately , his majesty’s impending visit here earned me special consideration , and i had some credit END_TOKEN
they say it’s best to patronize the place in person—at least jasnah always said…
she took a breath , steadying herself before continuing END_TOKEN
in any case , dalinar , the research is definitive END_TOKEN
we haven’t been able to find a single case where the effects of the old magic wore off—and it’s not like people haven’t tried over the centuries END_TOKEN
lore about people dealing with their curses , and seeking any cure for them , is practically its own genre END_TOKEN
as my researcher said , ‘old magic curses aren’t like a hangover , brightness END_TOKEN
she looked up at dalinar , and must have seen the emotion in his face , for she cocked her head END_TOKEN
i’ve never had anyone to share this burden with , he said softly END_TOKEN
could you at least confirm with the stormfather again that his bond with you is absolutely , for sure not what’s causing the memories to come back END_TOKEN
why would she want me to say more END_TOKEN
i have spoken , and spren do not change like men END_TOKEN
he says it’s not him , dalinar said END_TOKEN
he’s… annoyed at you for asking again END_TOKEN
this was something she shared with her daughter , a characteristic frustration with problems she couldn’t solve END_TOKEN
as if she were disappointed in the facts for not arranging themselves more helpfully END_TOKEN
maybe , she said , something was different about the deal you made END_TOKEN
if you can recount your visit to me sometime—with as much detail as you can remember—i’ll compare it to other accounts END_TOKEN
the valley had a lot of plants END_TOKEN
and… i remember… i asked to have my pain taken away , and she took memories too END_TOKEN
he shrugged , then noticed navani pursing her lips , her stare sharpening END_TOKEN
it’s not you , navani said END_TOKEN
giving you a deal when you were probably too distraught to think straight , then erasing your memory of the details END_TOKEN
i don’t think we can expect her to play by—or even understand—our rules END_TOKEN
he wished he could give her more , but even if he could dredge up something , this wasn’t the time END_TOKEN
they should be paying attention to their guests END_TOKEN
teshav had finished pointing out the strange glass panes on the inner walls that seemed like windows , only clouded END_TOKEN
she moved on to the pairs of discs on the floor and ceiling that looked something like the top and bottom of a pillar that had been removed—a feature of a number of rooms they’d explored END_TOKEN
once that was done , taravangian and adrotagia returned to the top of the room , near the windows END_TOKEN
the new radiant , malata , lounged in a seat near the wall - mounted sigil of the dustbringers , staring at it END_TOKEN
dalinar and navani climbed the steps to stand by taravangian END_TOKEN
an even better view than from the lift END_TOKEN
we think… we think that we are the most important things on roshar END_TOKEN
yet so much of roshar is empty of us END_TOKEN
yes… perhaps some of the old taravangian lingered in there somewhere END_TOKEN
is this where you’ll have us meet END_TOKEN
adrotagia asked , nodding toward the room END_TOKEN
when you’ve gathered all the monarchs , will this be our council chamber END_TOKEN
this seems too much like a lecture hall END_TOKEN
i don’t want the monarchs to feel as if they’re being preached to END_TOKEN
i am looking forward to meeting the others END_TOKEN
the king of azir… didn’t you tell me there was a new one , adrotagia END_TOKEN
i know queen fen—she’s very nice END_TOKEN
will we be inviting the shin END_TOKEN
do they even have a king END_TOKEN
don’t they live in tribes or something END_TOKEN
adrotagia tapped his arm fondly , but looked to dalinar , obviously curious about the other monarchs END_TOKEN
dalinar cleared his throat , but navani spoke END_TOKEN
so far , your majesty , she said , you are the only one who has heeded our warning call END_TOKEN
we’ve exchanged communications on five separate occasions , navani said END_TOKEN
in each one , the queen has dodged our requests END_TOKEN
azir has been even more stubborn END_TOKEN
iri dismissed us almost outright , dalinar said with a sigh END_TOKEN
neither marabethia nor rira would respond to the initial request END_TOKEN
there’s no real government in the reshi isles or some of the middle states END_TOKEN
babatharnam’s most ancient has been coy , and most of the makabaki states imply that they’re waiting for azir to make a decision END_TOKEN
the shin sent only a quick reply to congratulate us , whatever that means END_TOKEN
um , yes , dalinar said , uncomfortable at the king’s sudden change in attitude END_TOKEN
our primary focus has been on places with oathgates , for strategic reasons END_TOKEN
azir , thaylen city , and iri seem most essential END_TOKEN
however , we’ve made overtures to everyone who will listen , oathgate or no END_TOKEN
new natanan is being coy so far , and the herdazians think i’m trying to trick them END_TOKEN
the tukari scribes keep claiming they will bring my words to their god - king END_TOKEN
we actually got a reply from him , just a bit ago END_TOKEN
teshav’s ward was monitoring the spanreeds END_TOKEN
i’d like to hear it anyway END_TOKEN
she nodded , and went to collect it from teshav END_TOKEN
adrotagia gave him a questioning glance , but he didn’t dismiss the two of them END_TOKEN
he wanted them to feel they were part of an alliance , and perhaps they would have insights that would prove helpful END_TOKEN
navani returned with a single sheet of paper END_TOKEN
dalinar couldn’t read the script on it , but the lines seemed sweeping and grand—imperious END_TOKEN
‘a warning , ’ navani read , ‘from tezim the great , last and first man , herald of heralds and bearer of the oathpact END_TOKEN
his grandness , immortality , and power be praised END_TOKEN
lift up your heads and hear , men of the east , of your god’s proclamation END_TOKEN
his fury is ignited by your pitiful claims , and your unlawful capture of his holy city is an act of rebellion , depravity , and wickedness END_TOKEN
open your gates , men of the east , to his righteous soldiers and deliver unto him your spoils END_TOKEN
‘renounce your foolish claims and swear yourselves to him END_TOKEN
the judgment of the final storm has come to destroy all men , and only his path will lead to deliverance END_TOKEN
he deigns to send you this single mandate , and will not speak it again END_TOKEN
even this is far above what your carnal natures deserve END_TOKEN
well , at least it’s clear END_TOKEN
taravangian scratched at his head , brow furrowed , as if he didn’t agree with that statement at all END_TOKEN
i guess , dalinar said , we can cross the tukari off our list of possible allies END_TOKEN
i’d rather have the emuli anyway , navani said END_TOKEN
their soldiers might be less capable , but they’re also… well , not crazy END_TOKEN
taravangian said , looking from dalinar to adrotagia , uncertain END_TOKEN
we are alone , your majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
the end of the world has come , and still nobody will listen END_TOKEN
my aides say it is the traditional first step for an alethi aggression , but they also point out that if you could somehow take thaylenah , you’d completely control the straits and even the depths END_TOKEN
dalinar listened to the words with dismay END_TOKEN
so clear that even simpleminded taravangian saw it END_TOKEN
what else to make of alethkar proposing a union END_TOKEN
led by the blackthorn , the man who had united his own kingdom by the sword END_TOKEN
it was the suspicion that had tainted every conversation with the other monarchs END_TOKEN
taravangian didn’t come because he believed in my grand alliance END_TOKEN
he assumed that if he didn’t , i wouldn’t send my armies to herdaz or thaylenah—i’d send them to jah keved END_TOKEN
we’re not going to attack anyone , dalinar said END_TOKEN
our focus is on the voidbringers , the true enemy END_TOKEN
we will win the other kingdoms with diplomacy END_TOKEN
adrotagia , however , touched him on the arm and quieted him END_TOKEN
of course , brightlord , she said to dalinar END_TOKEN
what would he do if nobody listened END_TOKEN
how would he save roshar without the oathgates END_TOKEN
if our plan to reclaim kholinar works , he thought , wouldn’t it make sense to take the other gates the same way END_TOKEN
nobody would be able to fight both us and the voidbringers END_TOKEN
we could seize their capitals and force them—for their own good— to join our unified war effort END_TOKEN
he’d been willing to conquer alethkar for its own good END_TOKEN
he’d been willing to seize the kingship in all but name , again for the good of his people END_TOKEN
how far would he go for the good of all roshar END_TOKEN
how far would he go to prepare them for the coming of that enemy END_TOKEN
i will unite instead of divide END_TOKEN
he found himself standing at that window beside taravangian , staring out over the mountains , his memories of evi carrying with them a fresh and dangerous perspective END_TOKEN
i will confess my murders before you END_TOKEN
most painfully , i have killed someone who loved me dearly END_TOKEN
the tower of urithiru was a skeleton , and these strata beneath shallan’s fingers were veins that wrapped the bones , dividing and spreading across the entire body END_TOKEN
but what did those veins carry END_TOKEN
she slid through the corridors on the third level , in the bowels , away from civilization , passing through doorways without doors and rooms without occupants END_TOKEN
men had locked themselves in with their light , telling themselves that they’d conquered this ancient behemoth END_TOKEN
but all they had were outposts in the darkness END_TOKEN
these hallways had never seen the sun END_TOKEN
storms that raged through roshar never touched here END_TOKEN
this was a place of eternal stillness , and men could no more conquer it than cremlings could claim to have conquered the boulder they hid beneath END_TOKEN
she defied dalinar’s orders—the very ones she’d suggested—that all were to travel in pairs END_TOKEN
her satchel and safepouch were stuffed with new spheres recharged in the highstorm END_TOKEN
she felt gluttonous carrying so many , breathing in the light whenever she wished END_TOKEN
she was as safe as a person could be , so long as she had that light END_TOKEN
she wore veil’s clothing , but not yet her face END_TOKEN
she wasn’t truly exploring , though she did make a mental map END_TOKEN
she just wanted to be in this place , sensing it END_TOKEN
it could not be comprehended , but perhaps it could be felt END_TOKEN
jasnah had spent years hunting for this mythical city and the information she’d assumed it would hold END_TOKEN
navani spoke of the ancient technology she was sure this place must contain END_TOKEN
so far , she’d been disappointed END_TOKEN
she’d cooed over the oathgates , had been impressed by the system of lifts END_TOKEN
no majestic fabrials from the past , no diagrams explaining lost technology END_TOKEN
no books or writings at all END_TOKEN
and darkness , shallan thought , pausing in a circular chamber with corridors splitting out in seven diff rent directions END_TOKEN
she had felt the wrongness mraize spoke of END_TOKEN
she’d felt it the moment she’d tried to draw this place END_TOKEN
urithiru was like the impossible geometries of pattern’s shape END_TOKEN
invisible , yet grating , like a discordant sound END_TOKEN
she picked a direction at random and continued , finding herself in a corridor narrow enough that she could brush both walls with her fingers END_TOKEN
the strata had an emerald cast here , an alien color for stone END_TOKEN
she passed several small rooms before entering a much larger chamber END_TOKEN
she stepped into it , holding a diamond broam high for light , revealing that she was on a raised portion at the front of a large room with curving walls and rows of stone… benches END_TOKEN
it’s a theater , she thought END_TOKEN
and i’ve walked out onto the stage END_TOKEN
yes , she could make out a balcony above END_TOKEN
rooms like this struck her with their humanity END_TOKEN
everything else about this place was so empty and arid END_TOKEN
endless rooms , corridors , and caverns END_TOKEN
floors strewn with only the occasional bit of civilization’s detritus , like rusted hinges or an old boot’s buckle END_TOKEN
decayspren huddled like barnacles on ancient doors END_TOKEN
more alive , despite the span of the epochs END_TOKEN
she stepped into the center and twirled about , letting veil’s coat flare around her END_TOKEN
i always imagined being up on one of these END_TOKEN
when i was a child , becoming a player seemed the grandest job END_TOKEN
to get away from home , travel to new places END_TOKEN
to not have to be myself for at least a brief time each day END_TOKEN
pattern hummed , pushing out from her coat to hover above the stage in three dimensions END_TOKEN
it’s a stage for concerts or plays END_TOKEN
oh , you’d like them , she said END_TOKEN
people in a group each pretend to be someone different , and tell a story together END_TOKEN
she strode down the steps at the side , walking among the benches END_TOKEN
pattern hovered in the center of the stage , like a soloist END_TOKEN
a wonderful , wonderful lie , shallan said , settling onto a bench , veil’s satchel beside her END_TOKEN
a time when people all imagine together END_TOKEN
i wish i could see one , pattern said END_TOKEN
i could understand people… mmmm… through the lies they want to be told END_TOKEN
shallan closed her eyes , smiling , remembering the last time she’d seen a play at her father’s END_TOKEN
a traveling children’s troupe come to entertain her END_TOKEN
she’d taken memories for her collection—but of course , that was now lost at the bottom of the ocean END_TOKEN
the girl who looked up , she whispered END_TOKEN
shallan opened her eyes and breathed out stormlight END_TOKEN
she hadn’t sketched this particular scene , so she used what she had handy : a drawing she’d done of a young child in the market END_TOKEN
bright and happy , too young to cover her safehand END_TOKEN
the girl appeared from the stormlight and scampered up the steps , then bowed to pattern END_TOKEN
there was a girl , shallan said END_TOKEN
this was before storms , before memories , and before legends—but there was still a girl END_TOKEN
she wore a long scarf to blow in the wind END_TOKEN
a vibrant red scarf grew around the girl’s neck , twin tails extending far behind her and flapping in a phantom wind END_TOKEN
the players had made the scarf hang behind the girl using strings from above END_TOKEN
the girl in the scarf played and danced , as girls do today , shallan said , making the child prance around pattern END_TOKEN
in fact , most things were the same then as they are today END_TOKEN
shallan drained an indulgent number of spheres from her satchel , then sprinkled the floor of the stage with grass and vines like from her homeland END_TOKEN
across the back of the stage , a wall grew as shallan had imagined it END_TOKEN
a high , terrible wall stretching toward the moons END_TOKEN
blocking the sky , throwing everything around the girl into shadow END_TOKEN
the girl stepped toward it , looking up , straining to see the top END_TOKEN
you see , in those days , a wall kept out the storms , shallan said END_TOKEN
it had existed for so long , nobody knew how it had been built END_TOKEN
why wonder when the mountains began or why the sky was high END_TOKEN
like these things were , so the wall was END_TOKEN
the girl danced in its shadow , and other people sprang up from shallan’s light END_TOKEN
each was a person from one of her sketches END_TOKEN
vathah , gaz , palona , sebarial END_TOKEN
they worked as farmers or washwomen , doing their duties with heads bowed END_TOKEN
only the girl looked up at that wall , her twin scarf tails streaming behind her END_TOKEN
she approached a man standing behind a small cart of fruit , wearing kaladin stormblessed’s face END_TOKEN
she asked the man selling fruit , speaking with her own voice END_TOKEN
to keep the bad things out , he replied END_TOKEN
do not go beyond it , or you shall die END_TOKEN
the fruit seller picked up his cart and moved away END_TOKEN
and still , the girl looked up at the wall END_TOKEN
pattern hovered beside her and hummed happily to himself END_TOKEN
she asked the woman suckling her child END_TOKEN
to protect us , the woman said END_TOKEN
do not go beyond it , or you shall die END_TOKEN
the woman took her child and left END_TOKEN
the girl climbed a tree , peeking out the top , her scarf streaming behind her END_TOKEN
she called to the boy sleeping lazily in the nook of a branch END_TOKEN
the girl thrust her finger pointedly toward the wall END_TOKEN
that’s not a wall , the boy said , drowsy END_TOKEN
shallan had given him the face of one of the bridgemen , a herdazian END_TOKEN
that’s just the way the sky is over there END_TOKEN
it’s a wall , the girl said END_TOKEN
it must be there for a purpose , the boy said END_TOKEN
yes , it is a wall END_TOKEN
don’t go beyond it , or you’ll probably die END_TOKEN
well , shallan continued , speaking from the audience , these answers did not satisfy the girl who looked up END_TOKEN
she reasoned to herself , if the wall kept evil things out , then the space on this side of it should be safe END_TOKEN
so , one night while the others of the village slept , she sneaked from her home with a bundle of supplies END_TOKEN
she walked toward the wall , and indeed the land was safe END_TOKEN
always in the shadow of that wall END_TOKEN
no sunlight , ever , directly reached the people END_TOKEN
shallan made the illusion roll , like scenery on a scroll as the players had used END_TOKEN
only far , far more realistic END_TOKEN
she had painted the ceiling with light , and looking up , you seemed to be looking only at an infinite sky— dominated by that wall END_TOKEN
this is… this is far more extensive than i’ve done before , she thought , surprised END_TOKEN
creationspren had started to appear around her on the benches , in the form of old latches or doorknobs , rolling about or moving end over end END_TOKEN
well , dalinar had told her to practice END_TOKEN
the girl traveled far , shallan said , looking back toward the stage END_TOKEN
no predators hunted her , and no storms assaulted her END_TOKEN
the only wind was the pleasant one that played with her scarf , and the only creatures she saw were the cremlings that clicked at her as she walked END_TOKEN
at long last , the girl in the scarves stood before the wall END_TOKEN
it was truly expansive , running as far as she could see in either direction END_TOKEN
it reached almost to the tranquiline halls END_TOKEN
shallan stood and walked onto the stage , passing into a different land— an image of fertility , vines , trees , and grass , dominated by that terrible wall END_TOKEN
it grew spikes from its front in bristling patches END_TOKEN
i didn’t draw this scene out END_TOKEN
she’d drawn it as a youth , in detail , putting her imagined fancies down on paper END_TOKEN
of course she didn’t turn back , shallan said END_TOKEN
there were outcroppings in the wall , things like these spikes or hunched , ugly statues END_TOKEN
she had climbed the highest trees all through her youth END_TOKEN
had her hair been white when she’d started END_TOKEN
shallan made the base of the wall sink into the stage , so although the girl got higher , she remained chest - height to shallan and pattern END_TOKEN
the climb took days , shallan said , hand to her head END_TOKEN
at night , the girl who looked up would tie herself a hammock out of her scarf and sleep there END_TOKEN
she picked out her village at one point , remarking on how small it seemed , now that she was high END_TOKEN
as she neared the top , she finally began to fear what she would find on the other side END_TOKEN
unfortunately , this fear did not stop her END_TOKEN
she was young , and questions bothered her more than fear END_TOKEN
so it was that she finally struggled to the very top and stood to see the other side END_TOKEN
she remembered sitting at the edge of her seat , listening to this story END_TOKEN
as a child , when moments like watching the players had been the only bright spots in life END_TOKEN
too many memories of her father , and of her mother , who had loved telling her stories END_TOKEN
she tried to banish those memories , but they wouldn’t go END_TOKEN
her stormlight… she’d used up almost everything she’d pulled from her satchel END_TOKEN
out in the seats , a crowd of dark figures watched END_TOKEN
eyeless , just shadows , people from her memories END_TOKEN
the outline of her father , her mother , her brothers and a dozen others END_TOKEN
she couldn’t create them , because she hadn’t drawn them properly END_TOKEN
not since she’d lost her collection…
next to shallan , the girl stood triumphantly on the wall’s top , her scarves and white hair streaming out behind her in a sudden wind END_TOKEN
… and on that side of the wall , shallan whispered , the girl saw steps END_TOKEN
the back side of the wall was crisscrossed with enormous sets of steps leading down to the ground , so distant END_TOKEN
the girl stared at those steps , shallan whispered , remembering , and suddenly the gruesome statues on her side of the wall made sense END_TOKEN
the way it cast everything into shadow END_TOKEN
the wall did indeed hide something evil , something frightening END_TOKEN
it was the people , like the girl and her village END_TOKEN
the illusion started to break down around her END_TOKEN
this was too ambitious for her to hold , and it left her strained , exhausted , her head starting to pound END_TOKEN
she let the wall fade , claiming its stormlight END_TOKEN
the landscape vanished , then finally the girl herself END_TOKEN
behind , the shadowed figures in the seats started to evaporate END_TOKEN
stormlight streamed back to shallan , stoking the storm inside END_TOKEN
no , shallan said , stormlight puffing from her lips END_TOKEN
she goes down , sees a perfect society lit by stormlight END_TOKEN
she steals some and brings it back END_TOKEN
the storms come as a punishment , tearing down the wall END_TOKEN
ah… pattern said , hovering beside her on the now - dull stage END_TOKEN
so that’s how the storms first began END_TOKEN
of course not , shallan said , feeling tired END_TOKEN
she wiped her eyes and turned away from the empty stage END_TOKEN
she needed to get back to the markets END_TOKEN
in the seats , the last of the shadowy audience members puffed away END_TOKEN
all but one , who stood up and walked out the back doors of the theater END_TOKEN
startled , shallan felt a sudden shock run through her END_TOKEN
that figure hadn’t been one of her illusions END_TOKEN
she flung herself from the stage—landing hard , veil’s coat fluttering— and dashed after the figure END_TOKEN
she held the rest of her stormlight , a thrumming , violent tempest END_TOKEN
she skidded into the hall outside , glad for sturdy boots and simple trousers END_TOKEN
something shadowy moved down the corridor END_TOKEN
shallan gave chase , lips drawn to a sneer , letting stormlight rise from her skin and illuminate her surroundings END_TOKEN
as she ran , she pulled a string from her pocket and tied her hair back , becoming radiant END_TOKEN
radiant would know what to do if she caught this person END_TOKEN
can a person look that much like a shadow END_TOKEN
pattern , she shouted , thrusting her right hand forward END_TOKEN
luminescent fog formed there , becoming her shardblade END_TOKEN
light escaped her lips , transforming her more fully into radiant END_TOKEN
luminescent wisps trailed behind her , and she felt it chasing her END_TOKEN
she charged into a small round chamber and skidded to a stop END_TOKEN
a dozen versions of herself , from drawings she’d done recently , split around her and dashed through the room END_TOKEN
shallan in her dress , veil in her coat END_TOKEN
shallan as a child , shallan as a youth END_TOKEN
shallan as a soldier , a happy wife , a mother END_TOKEN
they vanished after passing her , collapsing one after another into stormlight that curled and twisted about itself before vanishing away END_TOKEN
radiant raised her shardblade in the stance adolin had been teaching her , sweat dripping down the sides of her face END_TOKEN
the room would have been dark but for the light curling off her skin and passing through her clothing to rise around her END_TOKEN
she’d either lost her quarry in the corridors , or it had been a spren and not a person at all END_TOKEN
or there was nothing there in the first place , a part of her worried END_TOKEN
your mind is not trustworthy these days END_TOKEN
no , pattern thought to her END_TOKEN
i was thinking on the lie END_TOKEN
she walked around the edge of the circular room END_TOKEN
the wall was scored by a series of deep slots that ran from floor to ceiling END_TOKEN
she could feel air moving through them END_TOKEN
what was the purpose of a room like this END_TOKEN
had the people who had designed this place been mad END_TOKEN
radiant noted faint light coming from several of the slots—and with it the sounds of people in a low , echoing clatter END_TOKEN
yes , she was in that region , and while she was on the third level , the market’s cavern was a full four stories high END_TOKEN
she moved to the next slot and peered through it , trying to decide just where it let out END_TOKEN
a dark mass wriggled deep inside , squeezing between walls END_TOKEN
like goo , but with bits jutting out END_TOKEN
those were elbows , ribs , fingers splayed along one wall , each knuckle bending backward END_TOKEN
a spren , she thought , trembling END_TOKEN
it is some strange kind of spren END_TOKEN
the thing twisted , head deforming in the tiny confines , and looked toward her END_TOKEN
she saw eyes reflecting her light , twin spheres set in a mashed head , a distorted human visage END_TOKEN
radiant pulled back with a sharp gasp , summoning her shardblade again and holding it wardingly before herself END_TOKEN
but what was she going to do END_TOKEN
hack her way through the stone to get to the thing END_TOKEN
did she even want to reach it END_TOKEN
the market , she thought , dismissing her blade and darting back the way she’d come END_TOKEN
with stormlight propelling her , radiant dashed through corridors , barely noticing as she breathed out enough to transform her face into veil’s END_TOKEN
she swerved through a network of twisted passages END_TOKEN
this maze , these enigmatic tunnels , were not what she’d expected from the home of the knights radiant END_TOKEN
shouldn’t this be a fortress , simple but grand—a beacon of light and strength in the dark times END_TOKEN
veil stumbled out of the back corridors into populated ones , then dashed past a group of children laughing and holding up chips for light and making shadows on the walls END_TOKEN
another few turns took her out onto the balcony walk around the cavernous breakaway market , with its bobbing lights and busy pathways END_TOKEN
veil turned left to see slots in the wall here END_TOKEN
the thing had come through one of these , but where had it gone after that END_TOKEN
a scream rose , shrill and cold , from the floor of the market below END_TOKEN
cursing to herself , veil took the steps at a reckless pace END_TOKEN
she sucked in her breath , and the stormlight puffing around her pulled in , causing her to stop glowing END_TOKEN
after a short dash , she found people gathering between two packed rows of tents END_TOKEN
the stalls here sold various goods , many of which looked to be salvage from the more abandoned warcamps END_TOKEN
more than a few enterprising merchants—with the tacit approval of their highprinces—had sent expeditions back to gather what they could END_TOKEN
with stormlight flowing and renarin to help with the oathgate , those had finally been allowed into urithiru END_TOKEN
the highprinces had gotten first pick END_TOKEN
the rest of their finds were heaped in the tents here , watched over by guards with long cudgels and short tempers END_TOKEN
veil shoved her way to the front of the crowd , finding a large horneater man cursing and holding his hand END_TOKEN
rock , she thought , recognizing the bridgeman though he wasn’t in uniform END_TOKEN
like it was stabbed right through the center , veil thought END_TOKEN
she demanded , still holding her light in to keep it from puffing out and revealing her END_TOKEN
rock eyed her while his companion—a bridgeman she thought she’d seen before—wrapped his hand END_TOKEN
who are you to ask me this thing END_TOKEN
she was veil right now , but she didn’t dare expose the ruse , especially not in the open END_TOKEN
i’m on aladar’s policing force , she said , digging in her pocket END_TOKEN
is fine , rock said , sighing , his wariness seeming to evaporate END_TOKEN
i did not see him well—long coat , and a hat END_TOKEN
a woman in crowd screamed , drawing my attention END_TOKEN
then , this man , he attacked END_TOKEN
the horneater looked to his companion END_TOKEN
attacker stabbed my hand , then ran END_TOKEN
person got angry about rule of tower , so he attacked me , for being in kholin guard END_TOKEN
the attacker had chosen a man who looked very similar to the one she had stabbed the other day END_TOKEN
in fact , they weren’t far from all’s alley END_TOKEN
just a few streets over in the market END_TOKEN
the two bridgemen turned to leave , and veil let them go END_TOKEN
the horneater had been targeted not because of anything he’d done , but because of how he looked END_TOKEN
and the attacker had been wearing a coat and hat END_TOKEN
i thought i’d find you here END_TOKEN
veil started , then whirled around , hand going to her belt knife END_TOKEN
the speaker was a woman in a brown havah END_TOKEN
she had straight alethi hair , dark brown eyes , bright red painted lips , and sharp black eyebrows almost certainly enhanced with makeup END_TOKEN
veil recognized this woman , who was shorter than she’d seemed while sitting down END_TOKEN
she was one of the thieves that veil had approached at all’s alley , the one whose eyes had lit up when shallan had drawn the ghostblood’s symbol END_TOKEN
what did he do to you END_TOKEN
the woman asked , nodding toward rock END_TOKEN
or do you just have a thing for stabbing horneaters END_TOKEN
this wasn’t me , veil said END_TOKEN
i’ve been waiting for you to turn up again END_TOKEN
you should stay away , if you value your life END_TOKEN
veil started off through the market END_TOKEN
the short woman scrambled after her END_TOKEN
i have experience moving in the market underground END_TOKEN
you want to be my ward END_TOKEN
she took veil by the arm END_TOKEN
but you… your group… you know things END_TOKEN
i don’t want to be blind anymore END_TOKEN
she could understand that desire to do something , rather than just feeling the world tremble and shake END_TOKEN
this woman would not find what she desired among them END_TOKEN
and if she did , then she was not the sort of person that shallan would want to add to mraize’s quiver END_TOKEN
do the smart thing and forget about me and my organization END_TOKEN
she pulled out of the woman’s grip and hurried away through the bustling market END_TOKEN
incense burned in a brazier as large as a boulder END_TOKEN
dalinar sniffled as evi threw a handful of tiny papers—each folded and inscribed with a very small glyph—into the brazier END_TOKEN
fragrant smoke washed over him , then whipped in the other direction as winds ripped through the warcamp , carrying windspren like lines of light END_TOKEN
evi bowed her head before the brazier END_TOKEN
she had strange beliefs , his betrothed END_TOKEN
among her people , simple glyphwards weren’t enough for prayers ; you needed to burn something more pungent END_TOKEN
while she spoke of jezrien and kelek , she said their names strangely : yaysi and kellai END_TOKEN
and she made no mention of the almighty—instead she spoke of something called the one , a heretical tradition the ardents told him came from iri END_TOKEN
dalinar bowed his head for a prayer END_TOKEN
let me be stronger than those who would kill me END_TOKEN
simple and to the point , the kind he figured the almighty would prefer END_TOKEN
he didn’t feel like having evi write it out END_TOKEN
the one watch you , near - husband , evi murmured END_TOKEN
her accent , to which he was now accustomed , was thicker than her brother’s END_TOKEN
evi , that’s not the point of battle END_TOKEN
you needn’t kill in anger , dalinar END_TOKEN
if you must fight , do it knowing that each death wounds the one END_TOKEN
for we are all people in yaysi’s sight END_TOKEN
yeah , all right , dalinar said END_TOKEN
the ardents didn’t seem to mind that he was marrying someone half pagan END_TOKEN
it is wisdom to bring her to vorin truth , jevena—gavilar’s head ardent—had told him END_TOKEN
similar to how she’d spoken of his conquest END_TOKEN
your sword will bring strength and glory to the almighty END_TOKEN
idly , he wondered what it would take to actually earn the ardents’ displeasure END_TOKEN
be a man and not a beast , dalinar , evi said , then pulled close to him , setting her head on his shoulder and encouraging him to wrap his arms around her END_TOKEN
he did so with a limp gesture END_TOKEN
storms , he could hear the soldiers snicker as they passed by END_TOKEN
the blackthorn , being consoled before battle END_TOKEN
evi turned her head toward him for a kiss , and he presented a chaste one , their lips barely touching END_TOKEN
and she did have a beautiful smile END_TOKEN
life would have been a lot easier for him if evi would have just been willing to move along with the marriage END_TOKEN
but her traditions demanded a long engagement , and her brother kept trying to get new provisions into the contract END_TOKEN
in his pocket he held another glyphward : one provided by navani , who obviously worried about the accuracy of evi’s foreign script END_TOKEN
he felt at the smooth paper , and didn’t burn the prayer END_TOKEN
the stone ground beneath his feet was pocked with tiny holes—the pinpricks of hiding grass END_TOKEN
as he passed the tents he could see it properly , covering the plain outside , waving in the wind END_TOKEN
tall stuff , almost as high as his waist END_TOKEN
he’d never seen grass that tall in kholin lands END_TOKEN
across the plain , an impressive force gathered : an army larger than any they’d faced END_TOKEN
after two years of political maneuvering , here they were END_TOKEN
a real battle with a real army END_TOKEN
win or lose , this was the fight for the kingdom END_TOKEN
the sun was on its way up , and the armies had arrayed themselves north and south , so neither would have it in their eyes END_TOKEN
dalinar hastened to his armorers’ tent , and emerged a short time later in his plate END_TOKEN
he climbed carefully into the saddle as one of the grooms brought his horse END_TOKEN
the large black beast wasn’t fast , but it could carry a man in shardplate END_TOKEN
dalinar guided the horse past ranks of soldiers—spearmen , archers , lighteyed heavy infantry , even a nice group of fifty cavalrymen under ilamar , with hooks and ropes for attacking shardbearers END_TOKEN
anticipationspren waved like banners among them all END_TOKEN
dalinar still smelled incense when he found his brother , geared up and mounted , patrolling the front lines END_TOKEN
your young friend didn’t show for the battle , gavilar noted END_TOKEN
there’s a hole in the enemy line , still waiting for him , gavilar said , pointing END_TOKEN
reports say he had a problem with his supply lines END_TOKEN
if he’d arrived , he’d have had to actually pick a side END_TOKEN
they rode past tearim , gavilar’s captain of the guard , who wore dalinar’s extra plate for this battle END_TOKEN
technically that still belonged to evi END_TOKEN
not toh , but evi herself , which was strange END_TOKEN
what would a woman do with shardplate END_TOKEN
give it to a husband , apparently END_TOKEN
he was capable with shards , having trained , as did many aspiring lighteyes , with borrowed sets END_TOKEN
you’ve done well , dalinar , gavilar said as they rode past END_TOKEN
that plate will serve us today END_TOKEN
even though evi and her brother had delayed such a painfully long time to even agree to the betrothal , dalinar had done his duty END_TOKEN
he just wished he felt more for the woman END_TOKEN
some passion , some true emotion END_TOKEN
he couldn’t laugh without her seeming confused by the conversation END_TOKEN
he couldn’t boast without her being disappointed in his bloodlust END_TOKEN
she always wanted him to hold her , as if being alone for one storming minute would make her wither and blow away END_TOKEN
one of the scouts called from a wooden mobile tower END_TOKEN
she pointed , her voice distant END_TOKEN
dalinar turned , expecting an advance attack from the enemy END_TOKEN
but no , kalanor’s army was still deploying END_TOKEN
it wasn’t men that had attracted the scout’s attention , but horses END_TOKEN
a small herd of them , eleven or twelve in number , galloping across the battlefield END_TOKEN
it’s rare they roam this far east END_TOKEN
dalinar swallowed an order to round up the beasts END_TOKEN
yes… he could see the spren trailing after them in the air END_TOKEN
well , no use trying to capture the beasts END_TOKEN
they couldn’t be held unless they chose a rider END_TOKEN
i want you to do something for me today , brother , gavilar said END_TOKEN
highprince kalanor himself needs to fall END_TOKEN
as long as he lives , there will be resistance END_TOKEN
if he dies , his line goes with him END_TOKEN
his cousin , loradar vamah , can seize power END_TOKEN
i’m certain of it , gavilar said END_TOKEN
then i’ll find kalanor , dalinar said , and end this END_TOKEN
he won’t join the battle easily , knowing him END_TOKEN
so we need to force him to engage END_TOKEN
i’m simply pleased to see you talking of tactics END_TOKEN
i’m not an idiot , dalinar growled END_TOKEN
he always paid attention to the tactics of a battle ; he simply wasn’t one for endless meetings and jaw wagging END_TOKEN
though… even those seemed more tolerable these days END_TOKEN
or maybe it was gavilar’s talk of forging a dynasty END_TOKEN
it was the increasingly obvious truth that this campaign—now stretching over many years—was no quick bash and grab END_TOKEN
bring me kalanor , brother , gavilar said END_TOKEN
all you need do is unleash him END_TOKEN
as if anyone existed who could leash him in the first place END_TOKEN
isn’t that what you’ve been trying to do END_TOKEN
marrying me off , talking about how we have to be civilized now END_TOKEN
highlighting everything i do wrong as the things we must expunge END_TOKEN
he bit his tongue , and they finished their ride down the lines END_TOKEN
they parted with a nod , and dalinar rode over to join his elites END_TOKEN
stay out of my way , dalinar said , lowering his faceplate END_TOKEN
the shardplate helm sealed closed , and a hush fell over the elites END_TOKEN
dalinar summoned oathbringer , the sword of a fallen king , and waited END_TOKEN
the enemy had come to stop gavilar’s continued pillage of the countryside ; they would have to make the first move END_TOKEN
these last few months spent attacking isolated , unprotected towns had made for unfulfilling battles—but had also put kalanor in a terrible position END_TOKEN
if he sat back in his strongholds , he allowed more of his vassals to be destroyed END_TOKEN
already those started to wonder why they paid kalanor taxes END_TOKEN
a handful had preemptively sent messengers to gavilar saying they would not resist END_TOKEN
the region was on the brink of flipping to the kholins END_TOKEN
and so , highprince kalanor had been forced to leave his fortifications to engage here END_TOKEN
dalinar shifted on his horse , waiting , planning END_TOKEN
the moment came soon enough ; kalanor’s forces started across the plain in a cautious wave , shields raised toward the sky END_TOKEN
gavilar’s archers released flights of arrows END_TOKEN
kalanor’s men were well trained ; they maintained their formations beneath the deadly hail END_TOKEN
eventually they met kholin heavy infantry : a block of men so armored that it might as well have been solid stone END_TOKEN
at the same time , mobile archer units sprang out to the sides END_TOKEN
lightly armored , they were fast END_TOKEN
if the kholins won this battle—and dalinar was confident they would—it would be because of the newer battlefield tactics they’d been exploring END_TOKEN
the enemy army found itself flanked—arrows pounding the sides of their assault blocks END_TOKEN
their lines stretched , the infantry trying to reach the archers , but that weakened the central block , which suffered a beating from the heavy infantry END_TOKEN
standard spearman blocks engaged enemy units as much to position them as to do them harm END_TOKEN
this all happened on the scale of the battlefield END_TOKEN
dalinar had to climb off his horse and send for a groom to walk the animal as he waited END_TOKEN
inside , dalinar fought back the thrill , which urged him to ride in immediately END_TOKEN
eventually , he picked a section of kholin troops who were faring poorly against the enemy block END_TOKEN
he remounted and kicked his horse into a gallop END_TOKEN
he needed to strike now , when the battle was pivoting between victory and loss , to draw out his enemy END_TOKEN
grass wriggled and pulled back in a wave before him END_TOKEN
this might be the end , his final battle in the conquest of alethkar END_TOKEN
what happened to him after this END_TOKEN
a brother who refused to look elsewhere for battle END_TOKEN
dalinar opened himself to the thrill and drove away such worries END_TOKEN
he struck the line of enemy troops like a highstorm hitting a stack of papers END_TOKEN
soldiers scattered before him , shouting END_TOKEN
dalinar laid about with his shardblade , killing dozens on one side , then the other END_TOKEN
eyes burned , arms fell limp END_TOKEN
dalinar breathed in the joy of the conquest , the narcotic beauty of destruction END_TOKEN
none could stand before him ; all were tinder and he the flame END_TOKEN
the soldier block should have been able to band together and rush him , but they were too frightened END_TOKEN
people spoke of common men bringing down a shardbearer , but surely that was a fabrication END_TOKEN
a conceit intended to make men fight back , to save shardbearers from having to hunt them down END_TOKEN
he grinned as his horse stumbled trying to cross the bodies piling around it END_TOKEN
dalinar kicked the beast forward , and it leaped—but as it landed , something gave END_TOKEN
the creature screamed and collapsed , dumping him END_TOKEN
he sighed , shoving aside the horse and standing END_TOKEN
he’d broken its back ; shardplate was not meant for such common beasts END_TOKEN
one group of soldiers tried a counterattack END_TOKEN
dalinar felled them with broad sweeps of his shardblade END_TOKEN
next , a lighteyed offi er organized his men to come press and try to trap dalinar , if not with their skill , then their weight of bodies END_TOKEN
he spun among them , plate lending him energy , blade granting him precision , and the thrill… the thrill giving him purpose END_TOKEN
in moments like this , he could see why he had been created END_TOKEN
he was wasted listening to men blab END_TOKEN
he was wasted doing anything but this : providing the ultimate test of men’s abilities , proving them , demanding their lives at the edge of a sword END_TOKEN
he sent them to the tranquiline halls primed and ready to fight END_TOKEN
enthralled , he cut down foe after foe , sensing a strange rhythm to the fighting , as if the blows of his sword needed to fall to the dictates of some unseen beat END_TOKEN
a redness grew at the edges of his vision , eventually covering the landscape like a veil END_TOKEN
it seemed to shift and move like the coils of an eel , trembling to the beats of his sword END_TOKEN
he was furious when a calling voice distracted him from the fight END_TOKEN
that voice was like a screeching cremling , playing its song inside his helm END_TOKEN
he felled a pair of swordsmen END_TOKEN
they’d been lighteyed , but their eyes had burned away , and you could no longer tell END_TOKEN
a man stood nearby , wearing kholin blue END_TOKEN
the man backed away , raising hands with no weapon , still shouting dalinar’s name END_TOKEN
one of the captains among his elites END_TOKEN
dalinar lowered his sword and shook his head , trying to get the buzzing sound out of his ears END_TOKEN
only then did he see—really see—what surrounded him END_TOKEN
hundreds upon hundreds of them , with shriveled coals for eyes , their armor and weapons sheared but their bodies eerily untouched END_TOKEN
almighty above… how many had he killed END_TOKEN
he raised his hand to his helm , turning and looking about him END_TOKEN
timid blades of grass crept up among the bodies , pushing between arms , fingers , beside heads END_TOKEN
he’d blanketed the plain so thoroughly with corpses that the grass had a difficult time finding places to rise END_TOKEN
dalinar grinned in satisfaction , then grew chill END_TOKEN
a few of those bodies with burned eyes—three men he could spot—wore blue END_TOKEN
his own men , bearing the armband of the elites END_TOKEN
blackthorn , your task is accomplished END_TOKEN
he pointed toward a troop of horsemen charging across the plain END_TOKEN
they carried the silver - on - red flag bearing a glyphpair of two mountains END_TOKEN
left no choice , highprince kalanor had committed to the battle END_TOKEN
dalinar had destroyed several companies on his own ; only another shardbearer could stop him END_TOKEN
he pulled off his helm and took a cloth from kadash , using it to wipe his face END_TOKEN
dalinar tossed away the empty skin , his heart racing , the thrill thrumming within END_TOKEN
do not engage unless i fall END_TOKEN
dalinar pulled his helm back on , and felt the comforting tightness as the latches cinched it into place END_TOKEN
gather those of us who… fell , dalinar said , waving toward the kholin dead END_TOKEN
make certain they , and theirs , are cared for END_TOKEN
dalinar dashed toward the oncoming force , his shardplate crunching against stones END_TOKEN
he felt sad to have to engage a shardbearer , instead of continuing his fight against the ordinary men END_TOKEN
no more laying waste ; he now had only one man to kill END_TOKEN
he could vaguely remember a time when facing lesser challenges hadn’t sated him as much as a good fight against someone capable END_TOKEN
his run took him toward one of the rock formations on the eastern side of the field—a group of enormous spires , weathered and jagged , like a row of stone stakes END_TOKEN
as he entered the shadows , he could hear fighting from the other side END_TOKEN
portions of the armies had broken off and tried to flank each other by rounding the formations END_TOKEN
at their base , kalanor’s honor guard split , revealing the highprince himself on horseback END_TOKEN
his plate was overlaid with a silver coloring , perhaps steel or silver leaf END_TOKEN
dalinar had ordered his plate buff d back to its normal slate grey ; he’d never understood why people would want to augment the natural majesty of shardplate END_TOKEN
kalanor’s horse was a tall , majestic animal , brilliant white with a long mane END_TOKEN
it carried the shardbearer with ease END_TOKEN
he patted the animal fondly on the neck , then stepped forward to meet dalinar , shardblade appearing in his hand END_TOKEN
i hear you’ve been single - handedly destroying my army END_TOKEN
they fight for the tranquiline halls now END_TOKEN
would that you had joined to lead them END_TOKEN
when i am too old and weak to fight here , i’ll welcome being sent END_TOKEN
curious , how quickly tyrants grow religious END_TOKEN
it must be convenient to tell yourself that your murders belong to the almighty instead END_TOKEN
they’d better not belong to him END_TOKEN
i worked hard for those kills , kalanor END_TOKEN
the almighty can’t have them ; he can merely credit them to me when weighing my soul END_TOKEN
then let them weigh you down to damnation itself END_TOKEN
kalanor waved back his honor guard , who seemed eager to throw themselves at dalinar END_TOKEN
alas , the highprince was determined to fight on his own END_TOKEN
he swiped with his sword , a long , thin shardblade with a large crossguard and glyphs down its length END_TOKEN
if i kill you , blackthorn , what then END_TOKEN
then sadeas gets a crack at you END_TOKEN
no honor on this battlefield , i see END_TOKEN
oh , don’t pretend you are any better , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i know what you did to rise to your throne END_TOKEN
you can’t pretend to be a peacemaker now END_TOKEN
considering what you did to the peacemakers , kalanor said , i’ll count myself lucky END_TOKEN
dalinar leaped forward , falling into bloodstance—a stance for someone who didn’t care if he got hit END_TOKEN
he was younger , more agile than his opponent END_TOKEN
he counted on being able to swing faster , harder END_TOKEN
strangely , kalanor chose bloodstance himself END_TOKEN
the two clashed , bashing their swords against one other in a pattern that sent them twisting about in a quick shuffle of footings—each trying to hit the same section of plate repeatedly , to open a hole to flesh END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , batting away his opponent’s shardblade END_TOKEN
kalanor was old , but skilled END_TOKEN
he had an uncanny ability to pull back before dalinar’s strikes , deflecting some of the force of the impact , preventing the metal from breaking END_TOKEN
after furiously exchanging blows for several minutes , both men stepped back , a web of cracks on the left sides of their plate leaking stormlight into the air END_TOKEN
it will happen to you too , blackthorn , kalanor growled END_TOKEN
if you do kill me , someone will rise up and take your kingdom from you END_TOKEN
dalinar came in for a power swing END_TOKEN
one step forward , then a twist all the way about END_TOKEN
kalanor struck him on the right side—a solid hit , but insignificant , as it was on the wrong side END_TOKEN
dalinar , on the other hand , came in with a sweeping stroke that hummed in the air END_TOKEN
kalanor tried to move with the blow , but this one had too much momentum END_TOKEN
the shardblade connected , destroying the section of plate in an explosion of molten sparks END_TOKEN
kalanor grunted and stumbled to the side , nearly tripping END_TOKEN
he lowered his hand to cover the hole in his armor , which continued to leak stormlight at the edges END_TOKEN
you fight like you lead , kholin , he growled END_TOKEN
dalinar ignored the taunt and charged instead END_TOKEN
kalanor ran away , plowing through his honor guard in his haste , shoving some aside and sending them tumbling , bones breaking END_TOKEN
dalinar almost caught him , but kalanor reached the edge of the large rock formation END_TOKEN
he dropped his blade—it puff d away to mist—and sprang , grabbing hold of an outcropping END_TOKEN
he reached the base of the natural tower moments later END_TOKEN
boulders littered the ground nearby ; in the mysterious way of the storms , this had probably been a hillside until recently END_TOKEN
the highstorm had ripped most of it away , leaving this unlikely formation poking into the air END_TOKEN
it would probably soon get blown down END_TOKEN
dalinar dropped his blade and leapt , snagging an outcropping , his fingers grinding on stone END_TOKEN
he dangled before getting a footing , then proceeded to climb up the steep wall after kalanor END_TOKEN
the other shardbearer tried to kick rocks down , but they bounced off dalinar harmlessly END_TOKEN
by the time dalinar caught up , they had climbed some fifty feet END_TOKEN
down below , soldiers gathered and stared , pointing END_TOKEN
dalinar reached for his opponent’s leg , but kalanor yanked it out of the way and then—still hanging from the stones—summoned his blade and began swiping down END_TOKEN
after getting battered on the helm a few times , dalinar growled and let himself slide down out of the way END_TOKEN
kalanor gouged a few chunks from the wall to send them clattering at dalinar , then dismissed his blade and continued upward END_TOKEN
dalinar followed more carefully , climbing along a parallel route to the side END_TOKEN
he eventually reached the top and peeked over the edge END_TOKEN
the summit of the formation was some flat - topped , broken peaks that didn’t look terribly sturdy END_TOKEN
kalanor sat on one of them , blade across one leg , his other foot dangling END_TOKEN
dalinar climbed up a safe distance from his enemy , then summoned oathbringer END_TOKEN
there was barely enough room up here to stand END_TOKEN
wind buffeted him , a windspren zipping around to one side END_TOKEN
though the forces had started out with equal numbers , below them were far more fallen men in silver and red strewn across the grassland than there were men in blue END_TOKEN
i wonder how many kings get such prime seating to watch their own downfall END_TOKEN
you were never a king , dalinar said END_TOKEN
kalanor stood and lifted his blade , extending it in one hand , point toward dalinar’s chest END_TOKEN
that , kholin , is all tied up in bearing and assumption END_TOKEN
clever , bringing me up here , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
dalinar had the obvious edge in a fair duel—and so kalanor brought random chance into the fight END_TOKEN
winds , unsteady footing , a plunge that would kill even a shardbearer END_TOKEN
at the very least , this would be a novel challenge END_TOKEN
kalanor changed to windstance , a more flowing , sweeping style of fighting END_TOKEN
dalinar chose stonestance for the solid footing and straightforward power END_TOKEN
they traded blows , shuffling back and forth along the line of small peaks END_TOKEN
each step scraped chips off the stones , sending them tumbling down END_TOKEN
kalanor obviously wanted to draw out this fight , to maximize the time for dalinar to slip END_TOKEN
dalinar tested back and forth , letting kalanor fall into a rhythm , then broke it to strike with everything he had , battering down in overhand blows END_TOKEN
each fanned something burning inside of dalinar , a thirst that his earlier rampage hadn’t sated END_TOKEN
dalinar scored a series of hits on kalanor’s helm , backing him up to the edge , one step away from a fall END_TOKEN
the last blow destroyed the helm entirely , exposing an aged face , clean - shaven , mostly bald END_TOKEN
kalanor growled , teeth clenched , and struck back at dalinar with unexpected ferocity END_TOKEN
dalinar met it blade with blade , then stepped forward to turn it into a shoving match—their weapons locked , neither with room to maneuver END_TOKEN
in those light grey eyes , he saw something END_TOKEN
dalinar had heard others speak of it , this euphoria of the contest END_TOKEN
but seeing it right there , in the eyes of a man trying to kill him , made dalinar furious END_TOKEN
he should not have to share such an intimate feeling with this man END_TOKEN
he grunted and—in a surge of strength—tossed kalanor back END_TOKEN
the man stumbled , then slipped END_TOKEN
he instantly dropped his shardblade and , in a frantic motion , managed to grab the rock lip as he fell END_TOKEN
the sense of the thrill in his eyes faded to panic END_TOKEN
this is a mercy , dalinar said , then struck him straight through the face with his shardblade END_TOKEN
kalanor’s eyes burned from grey to black as he dropped off the spire , trailing twin lines of black smoke END_TOKEN
the corpse scraped rock before hitting far below , on the far side of the rock formation , away from the main army END_TOKEN
dalinar breathed out , then sank down , wrung out END_TOKEN
shadows stretched long across the land as the sun met the horizon END_TOKEN
it had been a fine fight END_TOKEN
he’d conquered all who stood before him END_TOKEN
a voice within him kept saying , that’s it END_TOKEN
down below , a group in kalanor’s colors made for the fallen body END_TOKEN
the honor guard had seen where their brightlord had fallen END_TOKEN
dalinar felt a spike of outrage END_TOKEN
that was his kill , his victory END_TOKEN
he scrambled down in a reckless half - climb END_TOKEN
the descent was a blur ; he was seeing red by the time he hit the ground END_TOKEN
one soldier had the blade ; others were arguing over the plate , which was broken and mangled END_TOKEN
dalinar attacked , killing six in moments , including the one with the blade END_TOKEN
two others managed to run , but they were slower than he was END_TOKEN
dalinar caught one by the shoulder , whipping him around and smashing him down into the stones END_TOKEN
he killed the last with a sweep of oathbringer END_TOKEN
dalinar saw no men in red END_TOKEN
only some in blue—a beleaguered set of soldiers who flew no flag END_TOKEN
in their center , however , walked a man in shardplate END_TOKEN
gavilar rested here from the battle , in a place behind the lines , to take stock END_TOKEN
the hunger inside of dalinar grew END_TOKEN
the thrill came upon him in a rush , overwhelming END_TOKEN
why should he sit back so often , listening to men chat instead of war END_TOKEN
there was the man who held what he wanted END_TOKEN
a throne… a throne and more END_TOKEN
the woman dalinar should have been able to claim END_TOKEN
a love he’d been forced to abandon , for what reason END_TOKEN
no , his fighting today was not done END_TOKEN
he started toward the group , his mind fuzzy , his insides feeling a deep ache END_TOKEN
passionspren—like tiny crystalline flakes—dropped around him END_TOKEN
shouldn’t he be rewarded for all he had accomplished END_TOKEN
he intended to give up his momentum and rest upon what dalinar had won for him END_TOKEN
well , there was one way to make certain the war continued END_TOKEN
one way to keep the thrill alive END_TOKEN
one way for dalinar to get everything he deserved END_TOKEN
some of the men in gavilar’s group raised hands in welcome END_TOKEN
he could slaughter them all before they knew what had happened END_TOKEN
gavilar turned toward him , pulling free his helm and smiling an open , honest grin END_TOKEN
dalinar pulled up , stopping with a lurch END_TOKEN
he stared at gavilar , his brother END_TOKEN
oh , stormfather , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
he let the blade slip from his fingers and vanish END_TOKEN
gavilar strode up , unable to read dalinar’s horrified expression behind his helm END_TOKEN
as a blessing , no shamespren appeared , though he should have earned a legion of them in that moment END_TOKEN
highprince ruthar brought down gallam , winning shards for his son END_TOKEN
talanor took a blade , and i hear you finally drew out kalanor END_TOKEN
please tell me he didn’t escape you END_TOKEN
he… dalinar licked his lips , breathing in and out END_TOKEN
dalinar pointed toward the fallen form , visible only as a bit of silvery metal shining amid the shadows of the rubble END_TOKEN
dalinar , you wonderful , terrible man END_TOKEN
gloryspren burst around gavilar , golden orbs that rotated around his head like a crown END_TOKEN
dalinar blinked amid their cheering , and suddenly felt a shame so deep he wanted to crumple up END_TOKEN
this time , a single spren—like a falling petal from a blossom—drifted down around him END_TOKEN
blade and plate , dalinar said to gavilar urgently END_TOKEN
i won them both , but i give them to you END_TOKEN
what would she do with shards END_TOKEN
keep them , dalinar pled , grabbing his brother by the arm END_TOKEN
very well , if you insist , gavilar said END_TOKEN
i suppose you do already have plate to give your heir END_TOKEN
gavilar said , sending some men to recover kalanor’s blade and plate END_TOKEN
toh will have to agree , finally , that we can protect his line END_TOKEN
i suspect the wedding will happen within the month END_TOKEN
as would , likely , the official re - coronation where—for the first time in centuries—all ten highprinces of alethkar would bow before a single king END_TOKEN
dalinar sat down on a stone , pulling free his helm and accepting water from a young messenger woman END_TOKEN
never again , he swore to himself END_TOKEN
i give way for gavilar in all things END_TOKEN
let him have the throne , let him have love END_TOKEN
i do not back down from the things i have said , regardless of what the ardents demand END_TOKEN
the sounds of arguing politicians drifted to shallan’s ears as she sketched END_TOKEN
she sat on a stone seat at the back of the large meeting room near the top of the tower END_TOKEN
she’d brought a pillow to sit on , and pattern buzzed happily on the little pedestal END_TOKEN
she sat with her feet up , thighs supporting her drawing pad , stockinged toes curling over the rim of the bench in front of her END_TOKEN
not the most dignified of positions ; radiant would be mortified END_TOKEN
at the front of the auditorium , dalinar stood before the glowing map that shallan and he—somehow combining their powers—could create END_TOKEN
he’d invited taravangian , the highprinces , their wives , and their head scribes END_TOKEN
elhokar had come with kalami , who was scribing for him lately END_TOKEN
renarin stood beside his father in his bridge four uniform , looking uncomfortable—so basically , same as usual END_TOKEN
adolin lounged nearby , arms folded , occasionally whispering a joke toward one of the men of bridge four END_TOKEN
radiant should be down there , engaging in this important discussion about the future of the world END_TOKEN
the light was just so good up here , with these broad glass windows END_TOKEN
she was tired of feeling trapped in the dark hallways of the lower levels , always feeling that something was watching her END_TOKEN
she finished her sketch , then tipped it toward pattern , holding the sketchbook with her sleeved safehand END_TOKEN
he rippled up from his post to inspect her drawing : the slot obstructed by a mashed - up figure with bulging , inhuman eyes END_TOKEN
it has to be some kind of spren , right END_TOKEN
i feel i should know , pattern said END_TOKEN
this… this is a thing from long ago END_TOKEN
i cannot say , pattern replied END_TOKEN
it is not a thing of us END_TOKEN
shallan flipped the page over the top of her sketchbook and started on another drawing END_TOKEN
the others spoke further of their coalition , thaylenah and azir recurring as the most important countries to convince , now that iri had made it completely clear they had joined the enemy END_TOKEN
brightness kalami , dalinar was saying END_TOKEN
it listed a large gathering of the enemy in marat , was it END_TOKEN
yes , brightlord , the scribe said from her position at the reading desk END_TOKEN
you hypothesized it was the low population of the region that induced the voidbringers to gather there END_TOKEN
the iriali have taken the chance to strike eastward , as they’ve always wanted to , dalinar said END_TOKEN
meanwhile , areas like triax—around the southern half of central roshar—continue to go dark END_TOKEN
brightness kalami nodded , and shallan tapped her lips with her drawing pencil END_TOKEN
how could cities go completely dark END_TOKEN
these days major cities—particularly ports—would have hundreds of spanreeds in operation END_TOKEN
every lighteyes or merchant wanting to watch prices or keep in contact with distant estates would have one END_TOKEN
those in kholinar had started working as soon as the highstorms returned—and then they’d been cut off one by one END_TOKEN
their last reports claimed that armies were gathering near the city END_TOKEN
the enemy seemed to be able to locate spanreeds somehow END_TOKEN
at least they’d finally gotten word from kaladin END_TOKEN
a single glyph for time , implying they should be patient END_TOKEN
he’d been unable to get to a town to find a woman to scribe for him , and just wanted them to know he was safe END_TOKEN
assuming someone else hadn’t gotten the spanreed , and faked the glyph to put them off END_TOKEN
the enemy is making a play for the oathgates , dalinar decided END_TOKEN
all of their motions , save for the gathering in marat , indicate this END_TOKEN
my instincts say that army is planning to strike back at azir , or even to cross and try to assault jah keved END_TOKEN
i trust dalinar’s assessment , highprince aladar added END_TOKEN
if he believes this course to be likely , we should listen END_TOKEN
the oily man leaned against the wall across from the others , barely paying attention END_TOKEN
who cares what you say , aladar END_TOKEN
it’s amazing you can even see , considering the place you’ve gone and stuck your head these days END_TOKEN
aladar spun and thrust his hand to the side in a summoning posture END_TOKEN
dalinar stopped him , as ruthar must have known that he would END_TOKEN
shallan shook her head , letting herself instead be drawn farther into her sketching END_TOKEN
a few creationspren appeared at the top of her drawing pad , one a tiny shoe , the other a pencil like the one she used END_TOKEN
her sketch was of highprince sadeas , drawn without a specific memory END_TOKEN
she’d never wanted to add him to her collection END_TOKEN
she finished the quick sketch , then flipped to a sketch of brightlord perel , the other man they’d found dead in the hallways of urithiru END_TOKEN
she’d tried to re - create his face without wounds END_TOKEN
she flipped back and forth between the two END_TOKEN
they do look similar , shallan decided END_TOKEN
her next two pages were pictures of the two horneaters END_TOKEN
those two looked roughly similar as well END_TOKEN
why would the man who strangled his wife confess to that murder , but then swear he hadn’t killed the second woman END_TOKEN
one was already enough to get you executed END_TOKEN
that spren is mimicking the violence , she thought END_TOKEN
killing or wounding in the same way as attacks from previous days END_TOKEN
pattern hummed softly , drawing her attention END_TOKEN
shallan looked up to see someone strolling in her direction : a middle - aged woman with short black hair cut almost to the scalp END_TOKEN
she wore a long skirt and a buttoning shirt with a vest END_TOKEN
what is that you’re sketching , brightness END_TOKEN
hearing her own language so suddenly was strange to shallan , and her mind took a moment to sort through the words END_TOKEN
people , shallan said , closing her drawing pad END_TOKEN
you’re the one who came with taravangian END_TOKEN
i came to him for convenience , as spark suggested we might look to urithiru , now that it has been rediscovered END_TOKEN
shallan could see no sign of her spren END_TOKEN
do you suppose we really filled this entire chamber END_TOKEN
ten orders , shallan said , with hundreds of people in most END_TOKEN
yes , i’d assume we could fill it—in fact , i doubt everyone belonging to the orders could fit in here END_TOKEN
and now there are four of us , she said idly , eyeing renarin , who stood stiff beside his father , sweating beneath the scrutiny as people occasionally glanced at him END_TOKEN
there’s a flying bridgeman out there somewhere— and those are only the ones of us gathered here END_TOKEN
there are bound to be others like you , who are still looking for a way to reach us END_TOKEN
if they want to , malata said END_TOKEN
things don’t have to be the way they were END_TOKEN
it didn’t work out so well last time for the radiants , did it END_TOKEN
but maybe this isn’t the time to experiment either END_TOKEN
we could do worse than rely upon the past to survive this END_TOKEN
curious , the woman said , that we have only the word of a few stuffy alethi about this entire ‘desolation’ business , eh sister END_TOKEN
shallan blinked at the casual way it was said , along with a wink END_TOKEN
malata smiled and sauntered back toward the front of the room END_TOKEN
well , shallan whispered , she’s annoying END_TOKEN
it will be worse when she starts destroying things END_TOKEN
her spren… mmm… they like to break what is around them END_TOKEN
they want to know what is inside END_TOKEN
pleasant , shallan said , as she flipped back through her drawings END_TOKEN
this should be enough to present to dalinar and adolin , which she planned to do today , now that she had her sketches done END_TOKEN
i need to catch it , she thought END_TOKEN
and a few days later , this thing will try to copy that attack END_TOKEN
perhaps she could patrol the unexplored parts of the tower END_TOKEN
look for it , instead of waiting for it to attack END_TOKEN
each tunnel like a drawing’s impossible line…
shallan shook out of her reverie and looked up to see what was happening : ialai sadeas had arrived at the meeting , carried in a palanquin END_TOKEN
she was accompanied by a familiar figure : meridas amaram was a tall man , tan eyed , with a square face and solid figure END_TOKEN
he was also a murderer , a thief , and a traitor END_TOKEN
he had been caught trying to steal a shardblade—proof that what captain kaladin said about him was true END_TOKEN
shallan gritted her teeth , but found her anger… cool END_TOKEN
no , she would not forgive this man for killing helaran END_TOKEN
but the uncomfortable truth was that she didn’t know why , or how , her brother had fallen to amaram END_TOKEN
she could almost hear jasnah whispering to her : don’t judge without more details END_TOKEN
below , adolin had risen and stepped toward amaram , right into the center of the illusory map , breaking its surface , causing waves of glowing stormlight to ripple across it END_TOKEN
he stared murder at amaram , though dalinar rested his hand on his son’s shoulder , holding him back END_TOKEN
i am glad you have agreed to join the meeting END_TOKEN
we could use your wisdom in our planning END_TOKEN
i’m not here for your plans , dalinar , ialai said END_TOKEN
i’m here because it was a convenient place to find you all together END_TOKEN
i’ve been in conference with my advisors back at our estates , and the consensus is that the heir , my nephew , is too young END_TOKEN
this is no time for house sadeas to be without leadership , so i’ve made a decision END_TOKEN
ialai , dalinar said , stepping into the illusion beside his son END_TOKEN
i have an idea that , though untraditional , might—
tradition is our ally , dalinar , ialai said END_TOKEN
i don’t think you’ve ever understood that as you should END_TOKEN
highmarshal amaram is our house’s most decorated and well - regarded general END_TOKEN
he is beloved of our soldiers , and known the world over END_TOKEN
i name him regent and heir to the house title END_TOKEN
he is , for all intents , highprince sadeas now END_TOKEN
i would ask the king to ratify this END_TOKEN
king elhokar looked up from his seat , where he—seemingly—had been lost in thought END_TOKEN
yes , navani said , arms folded END_TOKEN
dalinar , amaram said , stepping down several of the steps toward the rest of them at the bottom of the auditorium END_TOKEN
that refined diction , that perfect face , that crisp uniform… this man was what every soldier aspired to be END_TOKEN
i’m not the only one who is good at playing pretend , she thought END_TOKEN
i hope , amaram continued , our recent… friction will not prevent us from working together for the needs of alethkar END_TOKEN
i have spoken to brightness ialai , and i think i have persuaded her that our differences are secondary to the greater good of roshar END_TOKEN
the greater good , dalinar said END_TOKEN
you think you are one to speak about what is good END_TOKEN
everything i’ve done is for the greater good , dalinar , amaram said , his voice strained END_TOKEN
i know you intend to pursue legal action against me END_TOKEN
i will stand at trial , but let us postpone that until after roshar has been saved END_TOKEN
dalinar regarded amaram for an extended , tense moment END_TOKEN
then he finally looked to his nephew and nodded in a curt gesture END_TOKEN
the throne acknowledges your act of regency , brightness , elhokar said to ialai END_TOKEN
my mother will wish a formal writ , sealed and witnessed END_TOKEN
dalinar met the eyes of amaram across the floating map END_TOKEN
highprince , amaram said back , tipping his head END_TOKEN
dalinar winced visibly , then pointed toward the exit END_TOKEN
perhaps , son , you should take a moment to yourself END_TOKEN
adolin pulled out of his father’s grip , stalking toward the exit END_TOKEN
shallan thought only a moment , then grabbed her shoes and drawing pad and hurried after him END_TOKEN
she caught up to adolin in the hallway outside , near where the palanquins for the women were parked , and took his arm END_TOKEN
he glanced at her , and his expression softened END_TOKEN
you seem angrier about him than you were before END_TOKEN
no , adolin muttered , i’m just annoyed END_TOKEN
we’re finally rid of sadeas , and now that takes his place END_TOKEN
when i was young , i used to look up to him END_TOKEN
i started getting suspicious when i was older , but i guess part of me still wanted him to be like they said END_TOKEN
a man above all the pettiness and the politics END_TOKEN
shallan wasn’t certain what she thought of the idea of a true soldier being the type who didn’t care about politics END_TOKEN
shouldn’t the why of what a man was doing be important to him END_TOKEN
there was some ideal she couldn’t quite grasp , a kind of cult of obedience—of caring only about the battlefield and the challenge it presented END_TOKEN
they walked onto the lift , and adolin fished out a free gemstone—a little diamond not surrounded by a sphere—and placed it into a slot along the railing END_TOKEN
stormlight began to drain from the stone , and the balcony shook , then slowly began to descend END_TOKEN
removing the gem would tell the lift to stop at the next floor END_TOKEN
a simple lever , pushed one way or the other , would determine whether the lift crawled upward or downward END_TOKEN
they descended past the top tier , and adolin took up position by the railing , looking out over the central shaft with the window all along one side END_TOKEN
they were starting to call it the atrium—though it was an atrium that ran up dozens upon dozens of floors END_TOKEN
kaladin’s not going to like this , adolin said END_TOKEN
the two of us spent weeks in jail because of the things that man did END_TOKEN
i think amaram killed my brother END_TOKEN
adolin wheeled around to stare at her END_TOKEN
amaram has a shardblade , shallan said END_TOKEN
i saw it previously in the hands of my brother , helaran END_TOKEN
he was older than i am , and left jah keved years ago END_TOKEN
from what i can gather , he and amaram fought at some point , and amaram killed him—taking the blade END_TOKEN
you know where amaram got that , right END_TOKEN
adolin raised his hand to his head END_TOKEN
the bridgeboy insisted that he’d saved amaram’s life by killing a shardbearer END_TOKEN
amaram then killed kaladin’s squad and took the shards for himself END_TOKEN
that’s basically the entire reason the two hate each other END_TOKEN
shallan , adolin said , stepping toward her END_TOKEN
why would your brother try to kill amaram END_TOKEN
did he maybe know the highlord was corrupt END_TOKEN
kaladin didn’t know any of that END_TOKEN
everyone would have been better off if he’d just let amaram die END_TOKEN
but how did your brother know END_TOKEN
adolin said , pacing across the balcony END_TOKEN
we didn’t talk much , shallan said , numb END_TOKEN
he left when i was young END_TOKEN
anything to get off this topic END_TOKEN
for this was something she could still tuck away in the back of her brain END_TOKEN
she did not want to think about kaladin and helaran END_TOKEN
it was a long , quiet ride to the bottom floors of the tower END_TOKEN
adolin wanted to go visit his father’s horse again , but she wasn’t interested in standing around smelling horse dung END_TOKEN
she got off on the second level to make her way toward her rooms END_TOKEN
there are more important things in this world , helaran had said to her father END_TOKEN
more important even than you and your crimes END_TOKEN
he was withholding the secrets from her like sweets to entice a child to obedience END_TOKEN
but all he wanted her to do was investigate the oddities in urithiru END_TOKEN
that was a good thing , wasn’t it END_TOKEN
shallan meandered through the hallways , following a path where sebarial’s workers had affixed some sphere lanterns to hooks on the walls END_TOKEN
locked up and filled with only the cheapest diamond spheres , they shouldn’t be worth the effort to break into , but the light they gave was also rather dim END_TOKEN
she should have stayed above ; her absence must have destroyed the illusion of the map END_TOKEN
was there a way she could learn to leave her illusions behind her END_TOKEN
they’d need stormlight to keep going END_TOKEN
in any case , shallan had needed to leave the meeting END_TOKEN
the secrets this city hid were too engaging to ignore END_TOKEN
she stopped in the hallway and dug out her sketchbook , flipping through pages , looking at the faces of the dead men END_TOKEN
absently turning a page , she came across a sketch she didn’t recall making END_TOKEN
a series of twisting , maddening lines , scribbled and unconnected END_TOKEN
pattern moved up her dress , stopping under her neck END_TOKEN
he hummed , an uncomfortable sound END_TOKEN
she flipped to the next page END_TOKEN
here she’d drawn a rush of lines sweeping out from a central point , confused and chaotic , transforming to the heads of horses with the flesh ripping off , their eyes wide , equine mouths screaming END_TOKEN
her fingers trembled as she turned to the next page END_TOKEN
she’d scribbled it entirely black , using a circular motion , spiraling toward the center point END_TOKEN
a deep void , an endless corridor , something terrible and unknowable at the end END_TOKEN
she trembled , part of her terrified , but she couldn’t abandon those secrets END_TOKEN
she had to have them , hold them , make them hers END_TOKEN
she turned sharply in the corridor , taking a path away from her room END_TOKEN
a short time later , she strode into the barracks where sebarial housed his soldiers END_TOKEN
there were plentiful spaces like this in the tower : vast networks of rooms with built - in stone bunks in the walls END_TOKEN
urithiru had been a military base ; that much was evident from its ability to efficiently house tens of thousands of soldiers on the lower levels alone END_TOKEN
in the common room of the barracks , men lounged with coats off , playing with cards or knives END_TOKEN
her passing caused a stir as men gaped , then leaped to their feet , debating between buttoning their coats and saluting END_TOKEN
whispers of radiant chased her as she walked into a corridor lined with rooms , where the individual platoons bunked END_TOKEN
she counted off doorways marked by archaic alethi numbers etched into the stone , then entered a specific one END_TOKEN
she burst in on vathah and his team , who sat inside playing cards by the light of a few spheres END_TOKEN
poor gaz sat on the chamber pot in a corner privy , and he yelped , pulling closed the cloth on the doorway END_TOKEN
guess i should have anticipated that , shallan thought , covering her blush by sucking in a burst of stormlight END_TOKEN
she folded her arms and regarded the others as they—lazily—climbed to their feet and saluted END_TOKEN
they were only twelve men now END_TOKEN
some had made their way to other jobs END_TOKEN
a few others had died in the battle of narak END_TOKEN
she’d kind of been hoping that they would all drift away—if only so she wouldn’t have to figure out what to do with them END_TOKEN
she now realized that adolin was right END_TOKEN
these men were a resource and , all things considered , had been remarkably loyal END_TOKEN
i , shallan told them , have been an awful employer END_TOKEN
don’t know about that , brightness , red said—she still didn’t know how the tall , bearded man had gotten his nickname END_TOKEN
the pay has come on time and you haven’t gotten too many of us killed END_TOKEN
oi got killed , shob said from his bunk , where he saluted—still lying down END_TOKEN
shut up , shob , vathah said END_TOKEN
oi’m dyin’ this time , sarge END_TOKEN
then at least you’ll be quiet , vathah said END_TOKEN
brightness , i agree with red END_TOKEN
yes , well , the free ride is over , shallan said END_TOKEN
vathah shrugged , but some of the others looked disappointed END_TOKEN
maybe adolin was right ; maybe deep down , men like this did need something to do END_TOKEN
they wouldn’t have admitted that fact , though END_TOKEN
i’m afraid it might be dangerous , shallan said , then smiled END_TOKEN
and it will probably involve you getting a little drunk END_TOKEN
finally , i will confess my humanity END_TOKEN
i have been named a monster , and do not deny those claims END_TOKEN
i am the monster that i fear we all can become END_TOKEN
the decision has been made , ’ teshav read , ‘to seal off this oathgate until we can destroy it END_TOKEN
we realize this is not the path you wished for us to take , dalinar kholin END_TOKEN
know that the prime of azir considers you fondly , and looks forward to the mutual benefit of trade agreements and new treaties between our nations END_TOKEN
‘a magical portal into the very center of our city , however , presents too severe a danger END_TOKEN
we will entertain no further pleas to open it , and suggest that you accept our sovereign will END_TOKEN
may yaezir bless and guide you END_TOKEN
dalinar punched his fist into his palm as he stood in the small stone chamber END_TOKEN
teshav and her ward occupied the writing podium and seat beside it , while navani had been pacing opposite dalinar END_TOKEN
king taravangian sat in a chair by the wall , hunched forward with hands clasped , listening with a concerned expression END_TOKEN
there’s still thaylenah , dalinar said END_TOKEN
teshav , see if queen fen will speak with me today END_TOKEN
he had jah keved and kharbranth from taravangian , and new natanan was responding positively END_TOKEN
with thaylenah , dalinar could at least forge a unified vorin coalition of all the eastern states END_TOKEN
that model might eventually persuade the nations of the west to join with them END_TOKEN
dalinar started pacing again as teshav contacted thaylenah END_TOKEN
he preferred little rooms like this one ; the large chambers were a reminder of how enormous this place was END_TOKEN
in a small room like this , you could pretend that you were in a cozy bunker somewhere END_TOKEN
of course , even in a small chamber there were reminders that urithiru wasn’t normal END_TOKEN
the strata on the walls , like the folds of a fan END_TOKEN
or the holes that commonly showed up at the tops of rooms , right where the walls met the ceiling END_TOKEN
the one in this room couldn’t help but remind him of shallan’s report END_TOKEN
was something in there , watching them END_TOKEN
could a spren really be murdering people in the tower END_TOKEN
it was nearly enough to make him pull out of the place END_TOKEN
for now , he’d quadrupled patrols and sent navani’s researchers searching for a possible explanation END_TOKEN
at least until he could come up with a solution END_TOKEN
as teshav wrote to queen fen , dalinar stepped up to the wall , suddenly bothered by that hole END_TOKEN
it was right by the ceiling , and too high for him to reach , even if he stood on a chair END_TOKEN
the bridgemen had described using stones to climb walls , so dalinar picked up a wooden chair and painted its back with shining light , using the palm of his left hand END_TOKEN
when he pressed the back of the chair against the wall , it stuck END_TOKEN
dalinar grunted , tentatively climbing up onto the seat of the chair , which hung in the air at about table height END_TOKEN
might as well make use of the time , he said , carefully balancing on the chair END_TOKEN
he jumped , grabbing the edge of the hole by the ceiling , and pulled himself up to look down it END_TOKEN
it was three feet wide , and about one foot tall END_TOKEN
it seemed endless , and he could feel a faint breeze coming out of it END_TOKEN
a moment later , a mink slunk into the main tunnel from a shadowed crossroad , carrying a dead rat in its mouth END_TOKEN
the tubular little animal twitched its snout toward him , then carried its prize away END_TOKEN
air is circulating through those , navani said as he hopped down off the chair END_TOKEN
perhaps some fabrial we have yet to discover END_TOKEN
dalinar looked back up at the hole END_TOKEN
miles upon miles of even smaller tunnels threaded through the walls and ceilings of an already daunting system END_TOKEN
and hiding in them somewhere , the thing that shallan had drawn…
your majesty , our time is growing short END_TOKEN
she’s still writing , teshav said END_TOKEN
just read it , teshav , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i’m used to fen by now END_TOKEN
are you ever going to leave me alone END_TOKEN
i haven’t slept a full night in weeks END_TOKEN
the everstorm has hit us twice now ; we’re barely keeping this city from falling apart END_TOKEN
i understand , your majesty , dalinar said END_TOKEN
and am eager to send you the aid i promised END_TOKEN
please , let us make a pact END_TOKEN
you’ve dodged my requests long enough END_TOKEN
nearby , the chair finally dropped from the wall and clattered to the floor END_TOKEN
he prepared himself for another round of verbal sparring , of half promises and veiled meanings END_TOKEN
fen had been growing increasingly formal during their exchanges END_TOKEN
the spanreed wrote , then halted almost immediately END_TOKEN
teshav looked at him , grave END_TOKEN
this is not a time to forge on alone END_TOKEN
‘you have to know by now , ’ came the reply , ‘that this coalition is never going to happen END_TOKEN
your garnet - lit tongue and pleasant words make it seem like you really assume this will work END_TOKEN
a queen would have to be either stupid or desperate to let an alethi army into the very center of her city END_TOKEN
i’ve been the former at times , and i might be approaching the latter , but… storms , kholin END_TOKEN
i’m not going to be the one who finally lets thaylenah fall to you people END_TOKEN
and on the off chance that you’re sincere , then i’m sorry END_TOKEN
it had an air of finality to it END_TOKEN
dalinar walked over to teshav , looking at the inscrutable squiggles on the page that somehow made up the women’s script END_TOKEN
he asked navani as she sighed and settled down into a chair next to teshav END_TOKEN
even he had assumed dalinar’s purpose was conquest END_TOKEN
and who wouldn’t , considering his history END_TOKEN
maybe it would be different if i could speak to them in person , he thought END_TOKEN
but without the oathgates , that was virtually impossible END_TOKEN
thank her for her time , dalinar said END_TOKEN
and tell her my offer remains on the table END_TOKEN
teshav started writing , and navani looked to him , noting what the scribe hadn’t—the tension in his voice END_TOKEN
i just need time to think END_TOKEN
he strode from the room before she could object , and his guards outside fell into step behind him END_TOKEN
he wanted some fresh air ; an open sky always seemed so inviting END_TOKEN
his feet didn’t take him in that direction , however END_TOKEN
he instead found himself roaming through the hallways END_TOKEN
same as always , people ignored him unless he had a sword in his hand END_TOKEN
storms , it was like they wanted him to come in swinging END_TOKEN
he stalked the halls for a good hour , getting nowhere END_TOKEN
eventually , lyn the messenger found him END_TOKEN
panting , she said that bridge four needed him , but hadn’t explained why END_TOKEN
dalinar followed her , shallan’s sketch a heavy weight in his mind END_TOKEN
had they found another murder victim END_TOKEN
indeed , lyn led him to the section where sadeas had been killed END_TOKEN
lyn led him to a balcony , where the bridgemen leyten and peet met him END_TOKEN
he asked as he met them END_TOKEN
leyten led him down some steps onto the wide field outside the first level of the tower , where three more bridgemen waited near some rows of stone planters , probably for growing tubers END_TOKEN
we noticed this by accident , leyten said as they walked among the planters END_TOKEN
the hefty bridgeman had a jovial way about him , and talked to dalinar—a highprince—as easily as he’d talk to friends at a tavern END_TOKEN
we’ve been running patrols on your orders , watching for anything strange END_TOKEN
and… well , peet noticed something strange END_TOKEN
he pointed up at the wall END_TOKEN
dalinar squinted , picking out a gouge cut into the rock wall END_TOKEN
what could score stone like that END_TOKEN
he looked down at the planter boxes nearest them END_TOKEN
and there , hidden between two of them , was a hilt protruding from the stone floor END_TOKEN
it was easy to miss , as the blade had sunk all the way down into the rock END_TOKEN
dalinar knelt beside it , then took a handkerchief from his pocket and used it to grab the hilt END_TOKEN
even though he didn’t touch the blade directly , he heard a very distant whine , like a scream in the back of someone’s throat END_TOKEN
he steeled himself , then yanked the blade out and set it across the empty planter END_TOKEN
the silvery blade curved at the end almost like a fishhook END_TOKEN
the weapon was even wider than most shardblades , and near the hilt it rippled in wave - like patterns END_TOKEN
he knew this sword , knew it intimately END_TOKEN
he’d carried it for decades , since winning it at the rift all those years ago END_TOKEN
the killer must have dropped it out that window END_TOKEN
it clipped the stone on its way down , then landed here END_TOKEN
that’s what we figured , brightlord , peet said END_TOKEN
dalinar looked down at the sword END_TOKEN
he seized the sword , bracing himself for the screams END_TOKEN
the cries of a dead spren END_TOKEN
they weren’t the shrill , painful shrieks he’d heard when touching other blades , but more of a whimper END_TOKEN
the sound of a man backed into a corner , thoroughly beaten and facing something terrible , but too tired to keep screaming END_TOKEN
dalinar steeled himself and carried the blade—a familiar weight—with the flat side against his shoulder END_TOKEN
he walked toward a different entrance back into the tower city , followed by his guards , the scout , and the five bridgemen END_TOKEN
you promised to carry no dead blade , the stormfather thundered in his head END_TOKEN
i’m not going to bond it END_TOKEN
the stormfather rumbled , low and dangerous END_TOKEN
this one doesn’t scream as loudly as others END_TOKEN
it remembers your oath , the stormfather sent END_TOKEN
it remembers the day you won it , and better the day you gave it up END_TOKEN
it hates you—but less than it hates others END_TOKEN
dalinar passed a group of hatham’s farmers who had been trying , without success , to get some lavis polyps started END_TOKEN
he drew more than a few looks ; even at a tower populated by soldiers , highprinces , and radiants , someone carrying a shardblade in the open was an unusual sight END_TOKEN
dalinar whispered as they entered the tower and climbed a stairway END_TOKEN
could we save the spren who made this blade END_TOKEN
i know of no way , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
it is dead , as is the man who broke his oath to kill it END_TOKEN
back to the lost radiants and the recreance—that fateful day when the knights had broken their oaths , abandoned their shards , and walked away END_TOKEN
dalinar had witnessed that in a vision , though he still had no idea what had caused it END_TOKEN
what had made them do something so drastic END_TOKEN
he eventually arrived at the sadeas section of the tower , and though guards in forest green and white controlled access , they couldn’t deny a highprince—particularly not dalinar END_TOKEN
runners dashed before him to carry word END_TOKEN
dalinar followed them , using their path to judge if he was going in the right direction END_TOKEN
he was ; she was apparently in her rooms END_TOKEN
he stopped at the nice wooden door , and gave ialai the courtesy of knocking END_TOKEN
one of the runners he had chased here opened the door , still panting END_TOKEN
brightness sadeas sat in a throne set in the center of the room END_TOKEN
dalinar , ialai said , nodding her head to him like a queen greeting a subject END_TOKEN
dalinar heaved the shardblade off his shoulder and set it carefully on the floor END_TOKEN
not as dramatic as spearing it through the stones , but now that he could hear the weapon’s screams , he felt like treating it with reverence END_TOKEN
what is this in exchange for END_TOKEN
no exchange , dalinar said , turning back END_TOKEN
my guards found it today ; the killer threw it out a window END_TOKEN
she narrowed her eyes at him END_TOKEN
i didn’t kill him , ialai , dalinar said wearily END_TOKEN
you don’t have the bite left in you to do something like that END_TOKEN
he ignored the gibe , looking to amaram END_TOKEN
the tall , distinguished man met his gaze END_TOKEN
i will see you in judgment someday , amaram , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i wish that i could trust your word END_TOKEN
i stand by what i was forced to do , brightlord , amaram said , stepping forward END_TOKEN
the arrival of the voidbringers only proves i was in the right END_TOKEN
the stories of darkeyes gaining blades are charming , but do you really think we have time for nursery tales now , instead of practical reality END_TOKEN
you murdered defenseless men , dalinar said through gritted teeth END_TOKEN
men who had saved your life END_TOKEN
and what of the hundreds , even thousands , your wars killed END_TOKEN
i respect you greatly , brightlord , amaram said END_TOKEN
your life has been one of grand accomplishment , and you have spent it seeking the good of alethkar END_TOKEN
but you—and take this with the respect i intend—are a hypocrite END_TOKEN
you stand where you do because of a brutal determination to do what had to be done END_TOKEN
it is because of that trail of corpses that you have the luxury to uphold some lofty , nebulous code END_TOKEN
well , it might make you feel better about your past , but morality is not a thing you can simply doff to put on the helm of battle , then put back on when you’re done with the slaughter END_TOKEN
he nodded his head in esteem , as if he hadn’t just rammed a sword through dalinar’s gut END_TOKEN
dalinar spun and left amaram holding oathbringer END_TOKEN
dalinar’s stride down the corridors was so quick that his entourage had to scramble to keep up END_TOKEN
leave me , he said to his guards and the bridgemen END_TOKEN
he turned , ready to lash out , but calmed himself END_TOKEN
i don’t intend to stray in the tower alone END_TOKEN
i will obey my own laws END_TOKEN
they reluctantly retreated , leaving his door unguarded END_TOKEN
he passed into his outer common room , where he’d ordered most of the furniture to be placed END_TOKEN
navani’s heating fabrial glowed in a corner , near a small rug and several chairs END_TOKEN
they finally had enough stormlight to power it END_TOKEN
drawn by the warmth , dalinar walked up to the fabrial END_TOKEN
he was surprised to find taravangian sitting in one of the chairs , staring into the depths of the shining ruby that radiated heat into the room END_TOKEN
well , dalinar had invited the king to use this common room when he wished END_TOKEN
dalinar wanted nothing but to be alone , and he toyed with leaving END_TOKEN
he wasn’t sure that taravangian had noticed him END_TOKEN
but that warmth was so welcoming END_TOKEN
there were few fires in the tower , and even with the walls to block wind , you always felt chilled END_TOKEN
he settled into the other chair and let out a deep sigh END_TOKEN
taravangian didn’t address him , bless the man END_TOKEN
together they sat by that not - fire , staring into the depths of the gem END_TOKEN
storms , how he had failed today END_TOKEN
he couldn’t even keep the alethi highprinces in line END_TOKEN
not quite like sitting by a hearth , is it END_TOKEN
taravangian finally said , his voice soft END_TOKEN
i miss the popping of the logs , the dancing of flamespren END_TOKEN
it does have its own charm though END_TOKEN
you can see the stormlight moving inside END_TOKEN
our own little storm , dalinar said END_TOKEN
captured , contained , and channeled END_TOKEN
taravangian smiled , eyes lit by the ruby’s stormlight END_TOKEN
dalinar kholin… do you mind me asking you something END_TOKEN
how do you know what is right END_TOKEN
a lofty question , your majesty END_TOKEN
you have denied the almighty , taravangian said END_TOKEN
i am not decrying you as a heretic END_TOKEN
i do not care , dalinar END_TOKEN
i’ve questioned the existence of deity myself END_TOKEN
i feel there must be a god , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
my mind and soul rebel at the alternative END_TOKEN
is it not our duty , as kings , to ask questions that make the minds and souls of other men cringe END_TOKEN
yes , there still is some of the old taravangian in there , dalinar thought END_TOKEN
he might be slow , but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t think END_TOKEN
i have felt warmth , dalinar said , coming from a place beyond END_TOKEN
a light i can almost see END_TOKEN
if there is a god , it was not the almighty , the one who called himself honor END_TOKEN
powerful , but still merely a creature END_TOKEN
then how do you know what is right END_TOKEN
he thought he could see something larger within the ruby’s light END_TOKEN
something that moved like a fish in a bowl END_TOKEN
‘on my sixtieth day , ’ dalinar whispered , ‘i passed a town whose name shall remain unspoken END_TOKEN
though still in lands that named me king , i was far enough from my home to go unrecognized END_TOKEN
not even those men who handled my face daily—in the form of my seal imprinted upon their letters of authority—would have known this humble traveler as their king END_TOKEN
taravangian looked to him , confused END_TOKEN
it’s a quote from a book , dalinar said END_TOKEN
a king long ago took a journey END_TOKEN
his destination was this very city END_TOKEN
the way of kings , is it END_TOKEN
‘in this town , i found men bedeviled END_TOKEN
a hogman , tasked in protecting the landlord’s beasts , had been assaulted END_TOKEN
he lived long enough , only , to whisper that three of the other hogmen had gathered together and done the crime END_TOKEN
‘i arrived as questions were being raised , and men interrogated END_TOKEN
you see , there were four other hogmen in the landlord’s employ END_TOKEN
three of them had been responsible for the assault , and likely would have escaped suspicion had they finished their grim job END_TOKEN
each of the four loudly proclaimed that he was the one who had not been part of the cabal END_TOKEN
no amount of interrogation determined the truth END_TOKEN
he doesn’t say at first , dalinar replied END_TOKEN
throughout his book , he raises the question again and again END_TOKEN
three of those men were violent threats , guilty of premeditated murder END_TOKEN
hang all four , taravangian whispered END_TOKEN
dalinar—surprised to hear such bloodthirst from the other man— turned END_TOKEN
taravangian looked sorrowful , not bloodthirsty at all END_TOKEN
the landlord’s job , taravangian said , is to prevent further murders END_TOKEN
i doubt that what the book records actually happened END_TOKEN
it is too neat , too simple a parable END_TOKEN
but assuming the story did occur as claimed , and there was absolutely no way of determining who was guilty… you have to hang all four END_TOKEN
one innocent dead , but three murderers stopped END_TOKEN
is it not the best good that can be done , and the best way to protect your people END_TOKEN
i sound like a madman , don’t i END_TOKEN
but is it not a particular madness to be charged with such decisions END_TOKEN
it’s difficult to address such questions without revealing our own hypocrisy END_TOKEN
hypocrite , amaram accused dalinar in his mind END_TOKEN
he and gavilar hadn’t used pretty justifications when they’d gone to war END_TOKEN
they’d done as men did : they’d conquered END_TOKEN
only later had gavilar started to seek validation for their actions END_TOKEN
why not let them all go END_TOKEN
if you can’t prove who is guilty—if you can’t be sure—i think you should let them go END_TOKEN
yes… one innocent in four is too many for you END_TOKEN
no , any innocent is too many END_TOKEN
you say that , taravangian said END_TOKEN
many people do , but our laws will claim innocent men—for all judges are flawed , as is our knowledge END_TOKEN
eventually , you will execute someone who does not deserve it END_TOKEN
this is the burden society must carry in exchange for order END_TOKEN
i hate that , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
but it’s not a matter of morality , is it END_TOKEN
how many guilty may be punished before you’d accept one innocent casualty END_TOKEN
when you consider , all calculations are meaningless except one END_TOKEN
has more good been done than evil END_TOKEN
if so , then the law has done its job END_TOKEN
and so… i must hang all four men END_TOKEN
and i would weep , every night , for having done it END_TOKEN
again , dalinar reassessed his impression of taravangian END_TOKEN
the king was soft - spoken , but not slow END_TOKEN
he was simply a man who liked to consider a great long time before committing END_TOKEN
nohadon eventually wrote , dalinar said , that the landlord took a modest approach END_TOKEN
though the punishment should have been death , he mixed together the guilt and innocence , and determined that the average guilt of the four should deserve only prison END_TOKEN
he was unwilling to commit , taravangian said END_TOKEN
he wasn’t seeking justice , but to assuage his own conscience END_TOKEN
what he did was , nevertheless , another option END_TOKEN
does your king ever say what he would have done END_TOKEN
the one who wrote the book END_TOKEN
he said the only course was to let the almighty guide , and let each instance be judged differently , depending on circumstances END_TOKEN
so he too was unwilling to commit , taravangian said END_TOKEN
his book was about his journey , dalinar said END_TOKEN
i think this was one he never fully answered for himself END_TOKEN
they sat by the not - fire for a time before taravangian eventually stood and rested his hand on dalinar’s shoulder END_TOKEN
i understand , he said softly , then left END_TOKEN
he was a good man , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
feeling stiff , dalinar rose from his seat and made his way through his rooms END_TOKEN
he didn’t stop at the bedroom , though the hour was growing late , and instead made his way onto his balcony END_TOKEN
to look out over the clouds END_TOKEN
taravangian is wrong , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
you are not a hypocrite , son of honor END_TOKEN
i am , dalinar said softly END_TOKEN
but sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a person who is in the process of changing END_TOKEN
he didn’t like the idea of change END_TOKEN
do i go to war with the other kingdoms , dalinar thought , and maybe save the world END_TOKEN
or do i sit here and pretend that i can do all this on my own END_TOKEN
do you have any more visions of nohadon END_TOKEN
dalinar asked the stormfather , hopeful END_TOKEN
i have shown you all that was created for you to see , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
then i should like to rewatch the vision where i met nohadon , dalinar said END_TOKEN
though let me go fetch navani before you begin END_TOKEN
i want her to record what i say END_TOKEN
would you rather i show the vision to her as well END_TOKEN
she could record it herself that way END_TOKEN
you can show the visions to others END_TOKEN
i was given this leave : to choose those who would best be served by the visions END_TOKEN
he paused , then grudgingly continued END_TOKEN
no , he did not like the idea of being bonded , but it was part of what he’d been commanded to do END_TOKEN
the stormfather could show the visions to others END_TOKEN
you can show them to anyone END_TOKEN
during a storm , i can approach anyone i choose , the stormfather said END_TOKEN
but you do not have to be in a storm , so you can join a vision in which i have placed someone else , even if you are distant END_TOKEN
the problem from the way of kings END_TOKEN
i’ve been wishing for a way to meet with the other monarchs in person END_TOKEN
i think that in a coming highstorm , queen fen of thaylenah is going to have a quite remarkable experience END_TOKEN
read , or listen , to someone who has passed between realms END_TOKEN
veil prowled through the breakaway market , hat pulled low , hands in her pockets END_TOKEN
nobody else seemed to be able to hear the beast that she did END_TOKEN
regular shipments of supplies through jah keved via king taravangian had set the market bustling END_TOKEN
fortunately , with a third radiant capable of working the oathgate now , less of shallan’s time was required END_TOKEN
spheres that glowed again , and several highstorms as proof that that would persist , had encouraged everyone END_TOKEN
excitement was high , trading brisk END_TOKEN
drink flowed freely from casks emblazoned with the royal seal of jah keved END_TOKEN
lurking within it all , somewhere , was a predator that only veil could hear END_TOKEN
she heard the thing in the silence between laughter END_TOKEN
it was the sound of a tunnel extending into the darkness END_TOKEN
the feel of breath on the back of your neck in a dark room END_TOKEN
how could they laugh while that void watched END_TOKEN
it had been a frustrating four days END_TOKEN
dalinar had increased patrols to almost ridiculous levels , but those soldiers weren’t watching the right way END_TOKEN
they were too easily seen , too disruptive END_TOKEN
veil had set her men to a more targeted surveillance in the market END_TOKEN
so far , they’d found nothing END_TOKEN
her team was tired , as was shallan , who suff red from the long nights as veil END_TOKEN
fortunately , shallan wasn’t doing anything particularly useful these days END_TOKEN
sword training with adolin each day—more frolicking and flirting than useful swordplay—and the occasional meeting with dalinar where she had nothing to add but a pretty map END_TOKEN
veil though… veil hunted the hunter END_TOKEN
dalinar acted like a soldier : increased patrols , strict rules END_TOKEN
he asked his scribes to find him evidence of spren attacking people in historical records END_TOKEN
he needed more than vague explanations and abstract ideas—but those were the very soul of art END_TOKEN
if you could explain something perfectly , then you’d never need art END_TOKEN
that was the difference between a table and a beautiful woodcutting END_TOKEN
you could explain the table : its purpose , its shape , its nature END_TOKEN
the woodcutting you simply had to experience END_TOKEN
she ducked into a tent tavern END_TOKEN
did it seem busier in here than on previous nights END_TOKEN
dalinar’s patrols had people on edge END_TOKEN
they were avoiding the darker , more sinister taverns in favor of ones with good crowds and bright lights END_TOKEN
gaz and red stood beside a pile of crates , nursing drinks and wearing plain trousers and shirts , not uniforms END_TOKEN
she hoped they weren’t too intoxicated yet END_TOKEN
veil pushed up to their position , crossing her arms on the boxes END_TOKEN
nothing yet , gaz said with a grunt END_TOKEN
not that we’re complaining , red added , grinning as he took a long pull on his drink END_TOKEN
this is the kind of soldiering i can really get behind END_TOKEN
it’s going to happen tonight , veil said END_TOKEN
i can smell it in the air END_TOKEN
you said that last night , veil , gaz said END_TOKEN
three nights ago , a friendly game of cards had turned to violence , and one player had hit another over the head with a bottle END_TOKEN
that often wouldn’t have been lethal , but it had hit just right and killed the poor fellow END_TOKEN
the perpetrator—one of ruthar’s soldiers—had been hanged the next day in the market’s central square END_TOKEN
as unfortunate as the event had been , it was exactly what she’d been waiting for END_TOKEN
an act of violence , one man striking the other END_TOKEN
she’d mobilized her team and set them in the taverns near where the fight occurred END_TOKEN
someone will get attacked with a bottle , in exactly the same way END_TOKEN
pick someone who looks like the man who died , and watch END_TOKEN
shallan had done sketches of the murdered man , a short fellow with long drooping mustaches END_TOKEN
veil had distributed them ; the men took her as no more than another employee END_TOKEN
the attack will come , veil said END_TOKEN
red pointed out two men in the tent who had mustaches and were of a similar height to the dead man END_TOKEN
veil nodded and dropped a few low - value spheres onto the table END_TOKEN
get something in you other than booze END_TOKEN
sure , sure , red said as gaz grabbed the spheres END_TOKEN
but tell me , sweetness , don’t you want to stay here with us a little longer END_TOKEN
most men who have made a pass at me end up missing a finger or two , red END_TOKEN
i’d still have plenty left to satisfy you , i promise END_TOKEN
she looked back at him , then started snickering END_TOKEN
that was a decently good line END_TOKEN
he sighed , but raised his mug farther before taking a pull on it END_TOKEN
where did you come from , anyway END_TOKEN
gaz said , inspecting her with his single eye END_TOKEN
shallan kind of sucked me up along the way , like a boat pulling flotsam into its wake END_TOKEN
she does that , red said END_TOKEN
living out the last light of your sphere , you know END_TOKEN
and then suddenly , you’re an honor guard to a storming knight radiant , and everyone’s looking up to you END_TOKEN
you know what to do if something happens END_TOKEN
they’d send one man to the meeting place , while the other tried to tail the attacker END_TOKEN
they knew there might be something weird about the man they chased , but she hadn’t told them everything END_TOKEN
veil walked back to the meeting point , near a dais at the center of the market , close to the well END_TOKEN
the dais looked like it had once held some kind of official building , but all that remained was the six - foot - high foundation with steps leading up to it on four sides END_TOKEN
here , aladar’s officers had set up central policing operations and disciplinary facilities END_TOKEN
she watched the crowds while idly spinning her knife in her fingers END_TOKEN
it was good to know how the two of them were different , but it was also good to know what they had in common END_TOKEN
yes , she scammed them on occasion , but she wasn’t a thief END_TOKEN
she was a lover of experience END_TOKEN
she was at her best in a crowded market , watching , thinking , enjoying END_TOKEN
now radiant… radiant could take people or leave them END_TOKEN
they were a tool , but also a nuisance END_TOKEN
how could they so often act against their own best interests END_TOKEN
the world would be a better place if they’d all simply do what radiant said END_TOKEN
barring that , they could at least leave her alone END_TOKEN
veil flipped her knife up and caught it END_TOKEN
they liked seeing things done well , in the right way END_TOKEN
they didn’t suffer fools , though veil could laugh at them , while radiant simply ignored them END_TOKEN
finally , veil thought , catching her knife and spinning END_TOKEN
she came alert , eager , drawing in stormlight END_TOKEN
vathah came barreling through the crowd , shoving aside a marketgoer END_TOKEN
it wasn’t like you said , he said END_TOKEN
the two took off back the way he’d come END_TOKEN
it wasn’t a bottle to the head END_TOKEN
my tent is near one of the buildings END_TOKEN
the stone ones that were here in the market , you know END_TOKEN
vathah pointed as they drew close END_TOKEN
you couldn’t miss the tall structure beside the tent he and glurv had been watching END_TOKEN
at the top , a corpse dangled from an outcropping , hanged by the neck END_TOKEN
the thing didn’t imitate the attack with the bottle… it imitated the execution that followed END_TOKEN
killer dropped the person up there , leaving them to twitch END_TOKEN
glurv is tailing , vathah said , pointing END_TOKEN
the two charged in that direction , shoving their way through the crowds END_TOKEN
they eventually spotted glurv up ahead , standing on the edge of the well , waving END_TOKEN
he was a squat man with a face that always looked swollen , as if it were trying to burst through its skin END_TOKEN
man wearing all black , he said END_TOKEN
ran straight toward the eastern tunnels END_TOKEN
he pointed toward where troubled marketgoers were peering down a tunnel , as if someone had just passed them in a rush END_TOKEN
vathah stayed with her longer than glurv— but with stormlight , she maintained a sprint no ordinary person could match END_TOKEN
she burst into the indicated hallway and demanded to know if anyone had seen a man pass this way END_TOKEN
veil followed , heart beating violently , stormlight raging within her END_TOKEN
if she failed the chase , she’d have to wait for two more people to be assaulted—if it even happened again END_TOKEN
the creature might hide , now that it knew she was watching END_TOKEN
she sprinted down this hallway , leaving behind the more populated sections of the tower END_TOKEN
a few last people pointed down a tunnel at her shouted question END_TOKEN
she was beginning to lose hope as she reached the end of the hallway at an intersection , and looked one way , then the other END_TOKEN
she glowed brightly to light the corridors for a distance , but she saw nothing in either END_TOKEN
she let out a sigh , slumping against the wall END_TOKEN
mmmm… pattern said from her coat END_TOKEN
she stepped forward , and something split out of the shadows , a figure that was jet black—though like a liquid or a polished stone , it reflected her light END_TOKEN
it scrambled away , its shape wrong END_TOKEN
veil ran , heedless of the danger END_TOKEN
this thing might be able to hurt her— but the mystery was the greater threat END_TOKEN
she needed to know these secrets END_TOKEN
shallan skidded around a corner , then barreled down the next tunnel END_TOKEN
she managed to follow the broken piece of shadow , but she couldn’t quite catch it END_TOKEN
the chase led her deeper into the far reaches of the tower’s ground floor , to areas barely explored , where the tunnels grew increasingly confusing END_TOKEN
the air smelled of old things END_TOKEN
of dust and stone left alone for ages END_TOKEN
the strata danced on the walls , the speed of her run making them seem to twist around her like threads in a loom END_TOKEN
the thing dropped to all fours , light from shallan’s glow reflecting off its coal skin END_TOKEN
it ran , frantic , until it hit a turn in the tunnel ahead and squeezed into a hole in the wall , two feet wide , near the floor END_TOKEN
radiant dropped to her knees , spotting the thing as it wriggled out the other side of the hole END_TOKEN
not that thick , she thought , standing END_TOKEN
she demanded , thrusting her hand to the side END_TOKEN
she attacked the wall with her shardblade , slicing chunks free , dropping them to the floor with a clatter END_TOKEN
the strata ran all the way through the stone , and the pieces she carved off had a forlorn , broken beauty to them END_TOKEN
engorged with light , she shoved up against the sliced wall , finally breaking through into a small room beyond END_TOKEN
much of its floor was taken up by the mouth of a pit END_TOKEN
circled by stone steps with no railing , the hole bored down through the rock into darkness END_TOKEN
radiant lowered her shardblade , letting it slice into the rock at her feet END_TOKEN
like her drawing of spiraling blackness , a pit that seemed to descend into the void itself END_TOKEN
she released her shardblade , falling to her knees END_TOKEN
pattern asked , rising up from the ground near where the blade had vanished END_TOKEN
but first… first , go and get adolin END_TOKEN
you won’t go alone , will you END_TOKEN
can you make your way back END_TOKEN
pattern buzzed affirmatively , then zipped off across the ground , dimpling the floor of the rock END_TOKEN
curiously , the wall near where she’d broken in showed the rust marks and remnants of ancient hinges END_TOKEN
so there was a secret door to get into this place END_TOKEN
she was drawn toward that blackness , but she wasn’t stupid END_TOKEN
she waited , transfixed by the pit , until she heard voices from the hallway behind her END_TOKEN
he can’t see me in veil’s clothing END_TOKEN
she thought , and started to reawaken END_TOKEN
how long had she been kneeling there END_TOKEN
she took off veil’s hat and long white coat , then hid them behind the debris END_TOKEN
stormlight enfolded her , painting the image of a havah over her trousers , gloved hand , and tight buttoned shirt END_TOKEN
she was shallan again—innocent , lively shallan END_TOKEN
quick with a quip , even when nobody wanted to hear it END_TOKEN
earnest , but sometimes over - eager END_TOKEN
that’s you , a part of her cried as she adopted the persona END_TOKEN
why do you have to paint that face over another END_TOKEN
she turned as a short , wiry man in a blue uniform entered the room , grey dusting his temples END_TOKEN
she’d spent some time around bridge four in the last few weeks , but still hadn’t learned them all END_TOKEN
adolin strode in next , wearing kholin blue shardplate , faceplate up , blade resting on his shoulder END_TOKEN
judging from the sounds out in the hallway— and the herdazian faces that peeked into the room—he had brought not only soldiers , but the entirety of bridge four END_TOKEN
that included renarin , who clomped in after his brother , clad in slate - colored shardplate END_TOKEN
renarin looked far less frail when fully armored , though his face didn’t seem like a soldier’s , even if he had stopped wearing his spectacles END_TOKEN
pattern approached and tried to slide up her illusory dress , but then stopped , backing away and humming in pleasure at the lie END_TOKEN
i see that , shallan said END_TOKEN
he came at me , adolin said , in the training rooms , screaming that you’d found the killer END_TOKEN
said that if i didn’t come , you’d probably—and i quote—‘go do something stupid without letting me watch END_TOKEN
you should visit the alethi court sometime , adolin said , stepping over to the pit END_TOKEN
we tracked the thing that has been assaulting people , shallan said END_TOKEN
it killed someone in the market , then it came here END_TOKEN
it’s a spren , shallan whispered END_TOKEN
but not like one i’ve ever seen END_TOKEN
it’s able to imitate a person for a time—but it eventually becomes something else END_TOKEN
a broken face , a twisted shape…
sounds like that girl you’ve been seeing , skar , one of the bridgemen noted END_TOKEN
ha ha , skar said dryly END_TOKEN
how about we toss you in that pit , eth , and see how far down this thing goes END_TOKEN
so this spren , lopen said , approaching the pit , it , sure , killed highprince sadeas END_TOKEN
it had killed perel in copying the sadeas murder , but someone else had murdered the highprince END_TOKEN
she glanced at adolin , who must have been thinking the same thing , for how solemn his expression was END_TOKEN
the spren was the greater threat—it had performed multiple murders END_TOKEN
still , it made her uncomfortable to acknowledge that her investigation hadn’t taken them a single step closer to finding who had killed the highprince END_TOKEN
we must have passed by this point a dozen times , a soldier said from behind END_TOKEN
shallan started ; that voice was female END_TOKEN
indeed , she’d mistaken one of dalinar’s scouts—the short woman with long hair—for another bridgeman , though her uniform was diff rent END_TOKEN
she was inspecting the cuts shallan had made to get into this room END_TOKEN
don’t you remember scouting right past that curved hallway outside , teft END_TOKEN
teft nodded , rubbing his bearded chin END_TOKEN
yeah , you’re right , lyn END_TOKEN
but why hide a room like this END_TOKEN
there’s something down there , renarin whispered , leaning out over the pit END_TOKEN
you’ve felt it , haven’t you END_TOKEN
he looked up at shallan , then the others in the room END_TOKEN
this place is weird ; this whole tower is weird END_TOKEN
you’ve noticed it too , right END_TOKEN
kid , teft said , you’re the expert on what’s weird END_TOKEN
shallan looked with concern toward renarin at the insult END_TOKEN
he just grinned , as one of the other bridgemen slapped him on the back—plate notwithstanding—while lopen and rock started arguing over who was truly the weirdest among them END_TOKEN
in a moment of surprise , she realized that bridge four had actually assimilated renarin END_TOKEN
he might be the lighteyed son of a highprince , resplendent in shardplate , but here he was just another bridgeman END_TOKEN
so , one of the men said , a handsome , muscled fellow with arms that seemed too long for his body , i assume we’re heading down into this awful crypt of terror END_TOKEN
she thought his name was drehy END_TOKEN
i brought the best men i could find , adolin said to shallan END_TOKEN
but i feel like i should bring an entire army instead END_TOKEN
you sure you want to do this now END_TOKEN
and… i don’t know that an army would make a difference END_TOKEN
teft , give us a hefty rearguard END_TOKEN
i don’t fancy having something sneak up on us END_TOKEN
lyn , i want accurate maps—stop us if we get too far ahead of your drawing END_TOKEN
i want to know my exact line of retreat END_TOKEN
be ready to perform a controlled , careful retreat if i command it END_TOKEN
then the group finally started down the staircase , single file , shallan and adolin near the center of the pack END_TOKEN
the steps jutted right from the wall , but were wide enough that people would be able to pass on their way up , so there was no danger of falling off she tried to keep from brushing anyone , as it might disturb the illusion that she was wearing her dress END_TOKEN
the sound of their footsteps vanished into the void END_TOKEN
soon they were alone with the timeless , patient darkness END_TOKEN
the light of the sphere lanterns the bridgemen carried didn’t seem to stretch far in that pit END_TOKEN
it reminded shallan of the mausoleum carved into the hill near her manor , where ancient davar family members had been soulcast to statues END_TOKEN
her father’s body hadn’t been placed there END_TOKEN
they had lacked the funds to pay for a soulcaster—and besides , they’d wanted to pretend he was alive END_TOKEN
she and her brothers had burned the body , as the darkeyes did END_TOKEN
i have to remind you , brightness , teft said from in front of her , you can’t expect anything… extraordinary from my men END_TOKEN
for a bit , some of us sucked up light and strutted about like we were stormblessed END_TOKEN
when kaladin returns , we’ll glow again good END_TOKEN
hush , lopen , teft said END_TOKEN
anyway , brightness , the lads will do their best , but you need to know what—and what not—to expect END_TOKEN
shallan hadn’t been expecting radiant powers from them ; she’d known about their limitation already END_TOKEN
eventually , lopen tossed a diamond chip into the hole , earning him a glare from adolin END_TOKEN
it might be down there waiting for us , the prince hissed END_TOKEN
the bridgeman wilted , but nodded END_TOKEN
the sphere bounced as a visible pinprick below , and shallan was glad to know that at least there was an end to this descent END_TOKEN
she’d begun to imagine an infinite spiral , like with old dilid , one of the ten fools END_TOKEN
he ran up a hillside toward the tranquiline halls with sand sliding beneath his feet—running for eternity , but never making progress END_TOKEN
several bridgemen let out audible sighs of relief as they finally reached the bottom of the shaft END_TOKEN
here , piles of splinters scattered at the edges of the round chamber , covered in decayspren END_TOKEN
there had once been a banister for the steps , but it had fallen to the effects of time END_TOKEN
the bottom of the shaft had only one exit , a large archway more elaborate than others in the tower END_TOKEN
up above , almost everything was the same uniform stone—as if this whole tower had been carved in one go END_TOKEN
here , the archway was of separately placed stones , and the walls of the tunnel beyond were lined with bright mosaic tiles END_TOKEN
once they entered the hall , shallan gasped , holding up a diamond broam END_TOKEN
gorgeous , intricate pictures of the heralds—made of thousands of tiles— adorned the ceiling , each in a circular panel END_TOKEN
the art on the walls was more enigmatic END_TOKEN
a solitary figure hovering above the ground before a large blue disc , arms stretched to the side as if to embrace it END_TOKEN
depictions of the almighty in his traditional form as a cloud bursting with energy and light END_TOKEN
a woman in the shape of a tree , hands spreading toward the sky and becoming branches END_TOKEN
who would have thought to find pagan symbols in the home of the knights radiant END_TOKEN
other murals depicted shapes that reminded her of pattern , windspren… ten kinds of spren END_TOKEN
adolin sent a vanguard a short distance ahead , and soon they returned END_TOKEN
metal doors ahead , brightlord , lyn said END_TOKEN
one on each side of the hall END_TOKEN
shallan pried her eyes away from the murals , joining the main body of the force as they moved END_TOKEN
they reached the large steel doors and stopped , though the corridor itself continued onward END_TOKEN
at shallan’s prompting , the bridgemen tried them , but couldn’t get them open END_TOKEN
locked , drehy said , wiping his brow END_TOKEN
adolin stepped forward , sword in hand END_TOKEN
these are artifacts from another time END_TOKEN
i won’t break them too much , he promised END_TOKEN
someone who is likely to , say , hide in a locked room END_TOKEN
she sighed , then nodded as he waved everyone back END_TOKEN
she tucked her safehand , which had brushed him , back under her arm END_TOKEN
it was so strange to feel like she was wearing a glove , but to see her hand as sleeved END_TOKEN
would it really have been so bad to let adolin know about veil END_TOKEN
a part of her panicked at the idea , so she let go of it quickly END_TOKEN
adolin rammed his blade through the door just above where the lock or bar would be , then swept it down END_TOKEN
teft tried the door , and was able to shove it open , hinges grinding loudly END_TOKEN
the bridgemen ducked in first , spears in hand END_TOKEN
for all teft’s insistence that she wasn’t to expect anything exceptional of them , they took point without orders , even though there were two shardbearers at the ready END_TOKEN
adolin rushed in after the bridgemen to secure the room , though renarin wasn’t paying much attention END_TOKEN
he’d walked a few steps farther down the main corridor , and now stood still , staring deeper into the depths , sphere held absently in one gauntleted hand , shardblade in the other END_TOKEN
shallan stepped up hesitantly beside him END_TOKEN
a cool breeze blew from behind them , as if being sucked into that darkness END_TOKEN
the mystery lurked in that direction , the captivating depths END_TOKEN
she could sense it more distinctly now END_TOKEN
not an evil really , but a wrongness END_TOKEN
like the sight of a wrist hanging from an arm after the bone is broken END_TOKEN
glys is frightened , and won’t speak END_TOKEN
pattern doesn’t know , shallan said END_TOKEN
your father doesn’t seem to be able to feel it , shallan said END_TOKEN
adolin said , looking out of the room , his faceplate up END_TOKEN
the wreckage inside the room was more decayed than most they’d found in the tower END_TOKEN
rusted clasps and screws clung to bits of wood END_TOKEN
decomposed heaps ran in rows , containing bits of fragile covers and spines END_TOKEN
they’d finally found the books jasnah had dreamed of discovering END_TOKEN
with a sinking feeling , shallan moved through the room , nudging at piles of dust and splinters with her toes , frightening off decayspren END_TOKEN
she found some shapes of books , but they disintegrated at her touch END_TOKEN
she knelt between two rows of fallen books , feeling lost END_TOKEN
all that knowledge… dead and gone END_TOKEN
sorry , adolin said , standing awkwardly nearby END_TOKEN
don’t let the men disturb this END_TOKEN
maybe… maybe there’s something navani’s scholars can do to recover it END_TOKEN
want us to search the other room END_TOKEN
she nodded , and he clanked off END_TOKEN
a short time later , she heard hinges creak as adolin forced open the door END_TOKEN
if these books here were gone , then it was unlikely they’d find others better preserved END_TOKEN
she rose , brushing off her knees , which only reminded her that her dress wasn’t real END_TOKEN
you aren’t here for this secret anyway END_TOKEN
she stepped out into the main hallway , the one with the murals END_TOKEN
adolin and the bridgemen were exploring the room on the other side , but a quick glance showed shallan that it was a mirror of the one they’d left , furnished only with piles of debris END_TOKEN
lyn , the scout , called END_TOKEN
renarin had walked farther down the corridor END_TOKEN
the scout had followed him , but had frozen in the hallway END_TOKEN
renarin’s sphere illuminated something in the distance END_TOKEN
a large mass that reflected the light , like glistening tar END_TOKEN
we shouldn’t have come here , renarin said END_TOKEN
the bridgemen hastened into the hallway in front of shallan , between her and renarin END_TOKEN
at a barked order from teft , they made a formation spanning from one side of the main hallway to the other : a line of men holding spears low , with a second line behind holding more spears higher in an overhand grip END_TOKEN
adolin burst out of the second library room , then gaped at the undulating shape in the distance END_TOKEN
that darkness seeped down the hallway END_TOKEN
it wasn’t fast , but there was an inevitability about the way it coated everything , flowing up the sides of the walls , onto the ceiling END_TOKEN
on the ground , shapes split from the main mass , becoming figures that stepped as if from the surf END_TOKEN
creatures that had two feet and soon grew faces , with clothing that rippled into existence END_TOKEN
re - shephir… the midnight mother END_TOKEN
men , start back up the hall END_TOKEN
then—of course—he charged at the flood of things END_TOKEN
the figures… they look like us , shallan thought , stepping back , farther from the line of bridgemen END_TOKEN
there was one midnight creature that looked like teft , and another that was a copy of lopen END_TOKEN
two larger shapes seemed to be wearing shardplate END_TOKEN
except they were made of shiny tar , their features blobby , imperfect END_TOKEN
the mouths opened , sprouting spiny teeth END_TOKEN
make a careful retreat , like the prince ordered END_TOKEN
don’t get boxed in , men END_TOKEN
renarin still stood out in front , holding forth his shardblade : long and thin , with a waving pattern to the metal END_TOKEN
adolin reached his brother , then grabbed his arm and tried to tow him back END_TOKEN
he seemed mesmerized by that line of forming monsters END_TOKEN
the boy’s head snapped up at the command and he scrambled—as if he weren’t the cousin of the king—to obey his sergeant’s order END_TOKEN
adolin retreated with him , and the two fell into formation with the bridgemen END_TOKEN
together , they pulled backward through the main hall END_TOKEN
shallan backed up , staying roughly twenty feet behind the formation END_TOKEN
suddenly , the enemy moved with a burst of speed END_TOKEN
shallan cried out , and the bridgemen cursed , turning spears as the main mass of darkness swept up along the sides of the corridor , covering the beautiful murals END_TOKEN
the midnight figures dashed forward , charging the line END_TOKEN
an explosive , frantic clash followed , bridgemen holding formation and striking at creatures who suddenly began forming on the right and left , coming out of the blackness on the walls END_TOKEN
the things bled vapor when struck , a darkness that hissed from them and dissipated into the air END_TOKEN
the tar swept down from the walls , surrounding the bridgemen , who circled to keep themselves from being attacked at the rear END_TOKEN
adolin and renarin fought at the very front , hacking with blades , leaving dark figures to hiss and gush smoke in pieces END_TOKEN
shallan found herself separated from the soldiers , an inky blackness between them END_TOKEN
there didn’t seem to be a duplicate for her END_TOKEN
the midnight faces bristled with teeth END_TOKEN
though they thrust with spears , they did so awkwardly END_TOKEN
they struck true now and then , wounding a bridgeman , who would pull back into the center of the formation to be hastily bandaged by lyn or lopen END_TOKEN
renarin fell into the center and started to glow with stormlight , healing those who were hurt END_TOKEN
shallan watched all this , feeling a numbing trance settle over her END_TOKEN
i… know you , she whispered to the blackness , realizing it was true END_TOKEN
adolin swept before himself , shardblade trailing black smoke from the creatures’ wounds END_TOKEN
he chopped apart dozens of the things , but new ones continued forming , wearing familiar shapes END_TOKEN
highprinces and scouts , soldiers and scribes END_TOKEN
you try to imitate us , shallan said END_TOKEN
she stepped toward the surrounded bridgemen END_TOKEN
adolin called , grunting as he cleaved three figures before him END_TOKEN
she ignored him , stepping up to the darkness END_TOKEN
in front of her—at the closest point of the ring—drehy stabbed a figure straight through the head , sending it stumbling back END_TOKEN
shallan seized its shoulders , spinning it toward her END_TOKEN
it was navani , a gaping hole in her face , black smoke escaping with a hiss END_TOKEN
even ignoring that , the features were off END_TOKEN
the nose too big , one eye a little higher than the other END_TOKEN
it dropped to the floor , writhing as it deflated like a punctured wineskin END_TOKEN
shallan strode right up to the formation END_TOKEN
the things fled her , shying to the sides END_TOKEN
shallan had the distinct and terrifying impression that these things could have swept the bridgemen away at will—overwhelming them in a terrible black tide END_TOKEN
but the midnight mother wanted to learn ; she wanted to fight with spears END_TOKEN
if that was so , however , she was growing impatient END_TOKEN
the newer figures forming up were increasingly distorted , more bestial , spiny teeth spilling from their mouths END_TOKEN
your imitation is pathetic , shallan whispered END_TOKEN
let me show you how it’s done END_TOKEN
shallan drew in her stormlight , going alight like a beacon END_TOKEN
things screamed , pulling away from her END_TOKEN
as she stepped around the formation of worried bridgemen—wading into the blackness at their left flank—figures extended from her , shapes growing from light END_TOKEN
the people from her recently rebuilt collection END_TOKEN
a group of soulcasters she’d passed two days ago END_TOKEN
men and women from the markets END_TOKEN
the man who had tried to pick up veil at the tavern END_TOKEN
the horneater she’d stabbed in the hand END_TOKEN
her figures spread out to surround the beleaguered bridgemen like sentries END_TOKEN
this new , glowing force drove the enemy monsters back , and the tar withdrew along the sides of the hall , until the path of retreat was open END_TOKEN
the midnight mother dominated the darkness at the end of the hall , the direction they had not yet explored END_TOKEN
it waited there , and did not recede farther END_TOKEN
the bridgemen relaxed , renarin muttering as he healed the last few who had been hurt END_TOKEN
shallan’s cohort of glowing figures moved forward and formed a line with her , between darkness and bridgemen END_TOKEN
the creatures formed again from the blackness ahead , growing more ferocious , like beasts END_TOKEN
featureless blobs with teeth sprouting from slit mouths END_TOKEN
adolin asked , voice ringing from within his helm END_TOKEN
has someone with a knife—not knowing who you were—ever tried to threaten you END_TOKEN
shallan stepped forward , and adolin joined her END_TOKEN
renarin summoned his blade and took a few quick steps to reach them , his plate clicking END_TOKEN
the darkness pulled back , revealing that the hallway opened up into a room ahead END_TOKEN
as she approached , shallan’s stormlight illuminated a bowl - like chamber END_TOKEN
the center was dominated by a heaving black mass that undulated and pulsed , stretching from floor to ceiling some twenty feet above END_TOKEN
the midnight beasts tested forward against her light , no longer seeming as intimidated END_TOKEN
we have to choose , shallan said to adolin and renarin END_TOKEN
this creature… she’s been watching me END_TOKEN
she’s changed how i see the tower END_TOKEN
i feel like i understand her , a connection i cannot explain END_TOKEN
that can’t be a good thing , right END_TOKEN
can we even trust what i think END_TOKEN
adolin raised his faceplate and smiled at her END_TOKEN
highmarshal halad always said that to beat someone , you must first know them END_TOKEN
it’s become one of the rules we follow in warfare END_TOKEN
and… what did he say about retreat END_TOKEN
‘plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat , but fight every battle like there is no backing down END_TOKEN
the main mass in the chamber undulated , faces appearing from its tarry surface—pressing out as if trying to escape END_TOKEN
there was something beneath the enormous spren END_TOKEN
yes , it was wrapped around a pillar that reached from the floor of the circular room to its ceiling END_TOKEN
the murals , the intricate art , the fallen troves of information… this place was important END_TOKEN
shallan clasped her hands before herself , and the patternblade formed in her palms END_TOKEN
she twisted it in a sweaty grip , falling into the dueling stance adolin had been teaching her END_TOKEN
not the screaming of a dead spren END_TOKEN
the pain of an ideal sworn , but not yet overcome END_TOKEN
you willing to give it another go END_TOKEN
we’ll last longer than you will , gancho END_TOKEN
adolin grinned and slammed his faceplate down END_TOKEN
she sent her illusions in , but the darkness didn’t shy before them as it had previously END_TOKEN
black figures attacked her illusions , testing to find that they weren’t real END_TOKEN
dozens of these midnight men clogged the way forward END_TOKEN
clear the way for me to the thing in the center , she said , trying to sound more certain than she felt END_TOKEN
i need to get close enough to touch her END_TOKEN
renarin , can you guard my back END_TOKEN
adolin took a deep breath , then charged into the room , bursting right through the middle of an illusion of his father END_TOKEN
he struck at the first midnight man , chopping it down , then began sweeping around him in a frenzy END_TOKEN
bridge four shouted , rushing in behind him END_TOKEN
together , they began to form a path for shallan , slaying the creatures between her and the pillar END_TOKEN
she walked through the bridgemen , a rank of them forming a spear line to either side of her END_TOKEN
ahead , adolin pushed toward the pillar , renarin at his back preventing him from being surrounded , bridgemen in turn pushing up along the sides to keep renarin from being overwhelmed END_TOKEN
the monsters no longer bore even a semblance of humanity END_TOKEN
they struck adolin , too - real claws and teeth scraping his armor END_TOKEN
others clung to him , trying to weigh him down or find chinks in the shardplate END_TOKEN
they know how to face men like him , shallan thought , still holding her shardblade in one hand END_TOKEN
why then do they fear me END_TOKEN
shallan wove light , and a version of radiant appeared near renarin END_TOKEN
the creatures attacked it , leaving renarin for a moment—unfortunately , most of her illusions had fallen , collapsing into stormlight as they were disrupted again and again END_TOKEN
she could have kept them going , she thought , with more practice END_TOKEN
instead , she wove versions of herself END_TOKEN
young and old , confident and frightened END_TOKEN
with a shock , she realized that several were pictures she’d lost , self - portraits she’d practiced with a mirror , as dandos the oilsworn had insisted was vital for an aspiring artist END_TOKEN
some of her selves cowered ; others fought END_TOKEN
for a moment shallan lost herself , and she even let veil appear among them END_TOKEN
she was those women , those girls , every one of them END_TOKEN
and none of them were her END_TOKEN
they were things she used , manipulated END_TOKEN
adolin shouted , voice straining as renarin grunted and ripped midnight men off him END_TOKEN
whatever you’re going to do , do it now END_TOKEN
she’d stepped up to the front of the column the soldiers had won for her , right near adolin END_TOKEN
she tore her gaze away from a child shallan dancing among the midnight men END_TOKEN
before her , the main mass—coating the pillar in the center of the room—bubbled with faces that stretched against the surface , mouths opening to scream , then submerged like men drowning in tar END_TOKEN
that pulsing mass , so terrible , but so captivating END_TOKEN
the twisting lines of the corridors END_TOKEN
the tower that couldn’t be completely seen END_TOKEN
shallan strode forward , arm out , and let the illusory sleeve covering her hand vanish END_TOKEN
she pulled off her glove , stepped right up to the mass of tar and voiceless screams END_TOKEN
then pressed her safehand against it END_TOKEN
listen to the words of a fool END_TOKEN
shallan was open to this thing END_TOKEN
laid bare , her skin split , her soul gaping wide END_TOKEN
it was also open to her END_TOKEN
she felt its confused fascination with humankind END_TOKEN
it remembered men— an innate understanding , much as newborn mink kits innately knew to fear the skyeel END_TOKEN
this spren was not completely aware , not completely cognizant END_TOKEN
she was a creation of instinct and alien curiosity , drawn to violence and pain like scavengers to the scent of blood END_TOKEN
shallan knew re - shephir at the same time as the thing came to know her END_TOKEN
the spren tugged and prodded at shallan’s bond with pattern , seeking to rip it free and insert herself instead END_TOKEN
pattern clung to shallan , and she to him , holding on for dear life END_TOKEN
she fears us , pattern’s voice buzzed in her head END_TOKEN
in her mind’s eye , shallan envisioned herself holding tightly to pattern in his humanoid form , the two of them huddled down before the spren’s attack END_TOKEN
that image was all she could see at the moment , for the room— and everything in it—had dissolved to black END_TOKEN
created long ago as a splinter of the soul of something even more terrible , re - shephir had been ordered to sow chaos , spawning horrors to confuse and destroy men END_TOKEN
over time , slowly , she’d become increasingly intrigued by the things she murdered END_TOKEN
her creations had come to imitate what she saw in the world , but lacking love or affection END_TOKEN
like stones come alive , content to be killed or to kill with no attachment or enjoyment END_TOKEN
no emotions beyond an overpowering curiosity , and that ephemeral attraction to violence END_TOKEN
almighty above… it’s like a creationspren END_TOKEN
pattern whimpered , huddled against shallan in his shape of a man with a stiff robe and a moving pattern for a head END_TOKEN
she tried to shield him from the onslaught END_TOKEN
fight every battle… as if there is… no backing down END_TOKEN
shallan looked into the depths of the swirling void , the dark spinning soul of re - shephir , the midnight mother END_TOKEN
then , growling , shallan struck END_TOKEN
she didn’t attack like the prim , excitable girl who had been trained by cautious vorin society END_TOKEN
she attacked like the frenzied child who had murdered her mother END_TOKEN
the cornered woman who had stabbed tyn through the chest END_TOKEN
she drew upon the part of her that hated the way everyone assumed she was so nice , so sweet END_TOKEN
the part of her that hated being described as diverting or clever END_TOKEN
she drew upon the stormlight within , and pushed herself farther into re - shephir’s essence END_TOKEN
she couldn’t tell if it was actually happening—if she was pushing her physical body farther into the creature’s tar—or if this was all a representation of someplace else END_TOKEN
a place beyond this room in the tower , beyond even shadesmar END_TOKEN
the creature trembled , and shallan finally saw the reason for its fear END_TOKEN
the event had happened recently in the spren’s reckoning , though shallan had the impression that in fact centuries upon centuries had passed END_TOKEN
re - shephir was terrified of it happening again END_TOKEN
the imprisonment had been unexpected , presumed impossible END_TOKEN
and it had been done by a lightweaver like shallan , who had understood this creature END_TOKEN
it feared her like an axehound might fear someone with a voice similar to that of its harsh master END_TOKEN
shallan hung on , pressing herself against the enemy , but realization washed over her—the understanding that this thing was going to know her completely , discover each and every one of her secrets END_TOKEN
her ferocity and determination wavered ; her commitment began to seep away END_TOKEN
she insisted that she wasn’t afraid END_TOKEN
she would continue that way forever END_TOKEN
power could be an illusion of perception END_TOKEN
it screeched , a sound that vibrated through shallan END_TOKEN
a screech that remembered its imprisonment and feared something worse END_TOKEN
shallan dropped backward in the room where they’d been fighting END_TOKEN
adolin caught her in a steel grip , going down on one knee with an audible crack of plate against stone END_TOKEN
she heard that echoing scream fading END_TOKEN
fleeing , escaping , determined to get as far from shallan as it could END_TOKEN
when she forced her eyes open , she found the room clean of the darkness END_TOKEN
the corpses of the midnight creatures had dissolved END_TOKEN
renarin quickly knelt next to a bridgeman who had been hurt , removing his gauntlet and infusing the man with healing stormlight END_TOKEN
adolin helped shallan sit up , and she tucked her exposed safehand under her other arm END_TOKEN
storms… she’d somehow kept up the illusion of the havah END_TOKEN
even after all of that , she didn’t want adolin to know of veil END_TOKEN
adolin pointed toward the other side of the room , where a tunnel extended farther down into the depths of the mountain END_TOKEN
it fled in that direction , like moving smoke END_TOKEN
so… should we chase it down END_TOKEN
eth asked , making his way carefully toward the tunnel END_TOKEN
his lantern revealed steps cut into the stone END_TOKEN
this goes down a long ways END_TOKEN
shallan could feel a change in the air END_TOKEN
don’t give chase , she said , remembering the terror of that conflict END_TOKEN
she was more than happy to let the thing run END_TOKEN
we can post guards in this chamber , but i don’t think she’ll return END_TOKEN
yeah , teft said , leaning on his spear and wiping sweat from his face END_TOKEN
guards seem like a very , very good idea END_TOKEN
shallan frowned at the tone of his voice , then followed his gaze , to look at the thing re - shephir had been hiding END_TOKEN
the pillar in the exact center of the room END_TOKEN
it was set with thousands upon thousands of cut gemstones , most larger than shallan’s fist END_TOKEN
together , they were a treasure worth more than most kingdoms END_TOKEN
if they cannot make you less foolish , at least let them give you hope END_TOKEN
throughout his youth , kaladin had dreamed of joining the military and leaving quiet little hearthstone END_TOKEN
everyone knew that soldiers traveled extensively and saw the world END_TOKEN
he’d seen dozens upon dozens of empty hills , weed - covered plains , and identical warcamps END_TOKEN
actual sights , though… well , that was another story END_TOKEN
the city of revolar was , as his hike with the parshmen had proven , only a few weeks away from hearthstone by foot END_TOKEN
storms , he’d never actually lived in a city before , unless you counted the warcamps END_TOKEN
he suspected most cities weren’t surrounded by an army of parshmen as this one was END_TOKEN
revolar was built in a nice hollow on the leeward side of a series of hills , the perfect spot for a little town END_TOKEN
except this was not a little town END_TOKEN
the city had sprawled out , filling in the areas between the hills , going up the leeward slopes—only leaving the tips completely bare END_TOKEN
he’d expected a city to look more organized END_TOKEN
he’d imagined neat rows of houses , like an efficient warcamp END_TOKEN
this looked more like a snarl of plants clumped in a chasm at the shattered plains END_TOKEN
streets running this way and that END_TOKEN
kaladin joined his team of parshmen as they wound along a wide roadway kept level with smoothed crem END_TOKEN
they passed through thousands upon thousands of parshmen camped here , and more gathered by the hour , it seemed END_TOKEN
his , however , was the only group that carried stone - headed spears on their shoulders , packs of dried grain biscuits , and hogshide leather sandals END_TOKEN
they tied their smocks with belts , and carried stone knives , hatchets , and tinder in waxed sleeves made from candles he’d traded for END_TOKEN
he’d even begun teaching them to use a sling END_TOKEN
he probably shouldn’t have shown them any of these things ; that didn’t stop him from feeling proud as he walked with them , entering the city END_TOKEN
where had all these parshmen come from END_TOKEN
this was a force of at least forty or fifty thousand END_TOKEN
he knew most people ignored parshmen… and , well , he’d done the same END_TOKEN
but he’d always had tucked into the back of his mind this idea that there weren’t that many out there END_TOKEN
each high - ranking lighteyes owned a handful END_TOKEN
and a lot of the caravaneers END_TOKEN
and , well , even the less wealthy families from cities or towns had them END_TOKEN
and there were the dockworkers , the miners , the water haulers , the packmen they used when building large projects END_TOKEN
it’s amazing , sah said from where he walked beside kaladin , carrying his daughter on his shoulder to give her a better view END_TOKEN
she clutched some of his wooden cards , holding them close like another child might carry a favorite stuffed doll END_TOKEN
our own city , kal , he whispered END_TOKEN
during my time as a slave , barely able to think , i still dreamed END_TOKEN
i tried to imagine what it would be like to have my own home , my own life END_TOKEN
the parshmen had obviously moved into homes along the streets here END_TOKEN
it raised a difficult , unsettling question END_TOKEN
khen’s group walked deeper into the city , still led by the unseen spren END_TOKEN
some of that would be from the everstorm , but he passed a couple of doors that had obviously been hacked open with axes END_TOKEN
and ahead stood an inner wall END_TOKEN
it was a nice fortification , right in the middle of the city sprawl END_TOKEN
it probably marked the original city boundary , as decided upon by some optimistic architect END_TOKEN
here , at long last , kaladin found signs of the fight he’d expected during his initial trip to alethkar END_TOKEN
the gates to the inner city lay broken END_TOKEN
the guardhouse had been burned , and arrowheads still stuck from some of the wood beams they passed END_TOKEN
but where had the humans been moved END_TOKEN
should he be looking for a prison camp , or a heaping pyre of burned bones END_TOKEN
considering the idea made him sick END_TOKEN
kaladin said as they walked down a roadway in the inner city END_TOKEN
is this what you want , sah END_TOKEN
storms , i don’t know , he said END_TOKEN
but i can’t be a slave again , kal END_TOKEN
i won’t let them take vai and imprison her END_TOKEN
would you defend them , after what they did to you END_TOKEN
if one of ‘your people’ murders another , don’t you put them in prison END_TOKEN
what is a just punishment for enslaving my entire race END_TOKEN
syl soared past , her face peeking from a shimmering haze of mist END_TOKEN
she caught his eye , then zipped over to a windowsill and settled down , taking the shape of a small rock END_TOKEN
but a war to exterminate one side or the other can’t be the answer END_TOKEN
you can fight alongside us , kal END_TOKEN
it doesn’t have to be about humans against parshmen END_TOKEN
it can be nobler than that END_TOKEN
as they passed the place where syl was , kaladin swept his hand along the wall END_TOKEN
syl , as they’d practiced , zipped up the sleeve of his coat END_TOKEN
he could feel her , like a gust of wind , move up his sleeve then out his collar , into his hair END_TOKEN
the long curls hid her , they’d determined , well enough END_TOKEN
there are a lot of those yellow - white spren here , kaladin , she whispered END_TOKEN
zipping through the air , dancing through buildings END_TOKEN
to the east , she said END_TOKEN
crammed into some army barracks and old parshman quarters END_TOKEN
others are in big pens , watched under guard END_TOKEN
kaladin… there’s another highstorm coming today END_TOKEN
i doubt anyone is expecting it END_TOKEN
everything has been thrown off ; the charts will all be wrong until people can make new ones END_TOKEN
kaladin hissed slowly through his teeth END_TOKEN
ahead , his team approached a large group of parshmen END_TOKEN
judging by the way they’d been organized into large lines , this was some kind of processing station for new arrivals END_TOKEN
indeed , khen’s band of a hundred was shuffled into one of the lines to wait END_TOKEN
ahead of them , a parshman in full carapace armor—like a parshendi— strolled down the line , holding a writing board END_TOKEN
syl pulled farther into kaladin’s hair as the parshendi man stepped up to khen’s group END_TOKEN
what towns , work camps , or armies do you all come from END_TOKEN
his voice had a strange cadence , similar to the parshendi kaladin had heard on the shattered plains END_TOKEN
some of those in khen’s group had hints of it , but nothing this strong END_TOKEN
the scribe parshman wrote down the list of towns khen gave him , then noted their spears END_TOKEN
i’ll recommend you for special training END_TOKEN
send your captive to the pens ; i’ll write down a description here , and once you’re settled , you can put him to work END_TOKEN
he… khen said , looking at kaladin END_TOKEN
he was one of the humans’ slaves , like us END_TOKEN
he wishes to join and fight END_TOKEN
the parshman looked up in the air at nothing END_TOKEN
yixli is speaking for you , sah whispered to kaladin END_TOKEN
well , the scribe said , it’s not unheard of , but you’ll have to get permission from one of the fused to label him free END_TOKEN
the parshman with the writing board pointed toward his left END_TOKEN
kaladin had to step out of the line , along with several of the others , to see a tall parshwoman with long hair END_TOKEN
there was carapace covering her cheeks , running back along the cheekbones and into her hair END_TOKEN
the skin on her arms prickled with ridges , as if there were carapace under the skin as well END_TOKEN
bridge four had described these creatures to him , the strange parshendi they’d fought during their push toward the center of the shattered plains END_TOKEN
these were the beings who had summoned the everstorm END_TOKEN
this one focused directly on kaladin END_TOKEN
there was something oppressive about her red gaze END_TOKEN
kaladin heard a clap of thunder in the far distance END_TOKEN
around him , many of the parshmen turned toward it and began to mutter END_TOKEN
in that moment , kaladin made his decision END_TOKEN
he’d stayed with sah and the others as long as he dared END_TOKEN
the tall , dangerous creature with the red eyes—the fused , they had called her—began walking toward khen’s group END_TOKEN
kaladin couldn’t know if she recognized him as a radiant , but he had no intention of waiting until she arrived END_TOKEN
he’d been planning ; the old slave’s instincts had already decided upon the easiest way out END_TOKEN
kaladin sucked in the stormlight , right from her pouch END_TOKEN
he burst alight with its power , then grabbed the pouch—he’d need those gemstones—and yanked it free , the leather strap snapping END_TOKEN
get your people to shelter , kaladin said to the surprised khen END_TOKEN
no matter what you are told , know this : i do not wish to be your enemy END_TOKEN
the fused began to scream with an angry voice END_TOKEN
kaladin met sah’s betrayed expression , then launched himself into the air END_TOKEN
storms , how he’d missed this END_TOKEN
the wind , the openness above , even the lurch in his stomach as gravity let go END_TOKEN
syl spun around him as a ribbon of light , creating a spiral of glowing lines END_TOKEN
gloryspren burst up about kaladin’s head END_TOKEN
syl took on the form of a person just so she could glower at the little bobbing balls of light END_TOKEN
mine , she said , swatting one of them aside END_TOKEN
about five or six hundred feet up , kaladin changed to a half lashing , so he slowed and hovered in the sky END_TOKEN
beneath , that red - eyed parshwoman was gesturing and screaming , though kaladin couldn’t hear her END_TOKEN
he hoped this wouldn’t mean trouble for sah and the others END_TOKEN
he had an excellent view of the city—the streets filled with figures , now making for shelter in buildings END_TOKEN
other groups rushed to the city from all directions END_TOKEN
even after spending so much time with them , his first reaction was one of discomfort END_TOKEN
so many parshmen together in one place END_TOKEN
this impression bothered him now as it never would have before END_TOKEN
he eyed the stormwall , which he could see approaching in the far distance END_TOKEN
he still had time before it arrived END_TOKEN
he’d have to fly up above the storm to avoid being caught in its winds END_TOKEN
urithiru is out there somewhere , to the west , kaladin said END_TOKEN
you’re a force of nature , syl , kaladin said END_TOKEN
don’t you have some kind of… location sense END_TOKEN
you’re the one from this realm , she said , batting away another gloryspren and hanging in the air beside him , folding her arms END_TOKEN
besides , i’m less a force of nature and more one of the raw powers of creation transformed by collective human imagination into a personification of one of their ideals END_TOKEN
where did you come up with that END_TOKEN
maybe i heard it somewhere once END_TOKEN
we’ll have to make for the shattered plains , then , kaladin said END_TOKEN
we can strike out for one of the larger cities in southern alethkar , swap gemstones there , and hopefully have enough to hop over to the warcamps END_TOKEN
that decided , he tied his gemstone pouch to his belt , then glanced down and tried to make a final estimate of troop numbers and parshman fortifications END_TOKEN
it felt odd to not worry about the storm , but he’d just move up over it once it arrived END_TOKEN
from up here , kaladin could see the great trenches cut into the stones to divert away floodwaters after a storm END_TOKEN
though most of the parshmen had fled for shelter , some remained below , craning necks and staring up at him END_TOKEN
he read betrayal in their postures , though he couldn’t even tell if these were members of khen’s group or not END_TOKEN
syl asked , alighting on his shoulder END_TOKEN
i can’t help but feel a kinship to them , syl END_TOKEN
and they’re angry , with good reason END_TOKEN
a gust of wind blew across him , making him drift to the side END_TOKEN
it burns in you , worms inside your brain until you forget everything but the injustice done to you END_TOKEN
it’s how i felt about elhokar END_TOKEN
sometimes a world of rational explanations can become meaningless in the face of that all - consuming desire to get what you deserve END_TOKEN
you changed your mind about elhokar , kaladin END_TOKEN
did i find what was right , or did i just finally agree to see things the way you wanted END_TOKEN
and the parshmen on the shattered plains that i killed END_TOKEN
which , for all we know , they did because they saw how king gavilar and his people treated the parshmen END_TOKEN
kaladin turned toward syl , who sat on his shoulder , one leg tucked beneath her END_TOKEN
so what’s the difference , syl END_TOKEN
what is the diff rence between dalinar attacking the parshmen , and these parshmen conquering that city END_TOKEN
i don’t know , she said softly END_TOKEN
and why was it worse for me to let elhokar be killed for his injustices than it was for me to actively kill parshmen on the shattered plains END_TOKEN
i mean , it just feels wrong END_TOKEN
except one nearly broke my bond , while the other didn’t END_TOKEN
the bond isn’t about what’s right and wrong , is it , syl END_TOKEN
it’s about what you see as right and wrong END_TOKEN
what we see , she corrected END_TOKEN
tell me that during your time planning to betray elhokar , you didn’t—deep down—think you were doing something wrong END_TOKEN
kaladin let the winds blow him , feeling a pit open in his belly END_TOKEN
storms , i’d hoped… i’d hoped you could tell me , give me an absolute right END_TOKEN
for once , i’d like my moral code not to come with a list of exceptions at the end END_TOKEN
i’d have expected you to object , kaladin said END_TOKEN
you’re a… what , embodiment of human perceptions of honor END_TOKEN
shouldn’t you at least think you have all the answers END_TOKEN
or maybe if there are answers , i should be the one who wants to find them END_TOKEN
the stormwall was now fully visible : the great wall of water and refuse pushed by the oncoming winds of a highstorm END_TOKEN
kaladin had drifted along with the winds away from the city , so he lashed himself eastward until they floated over the hills that made up the city’s windbreak END_TOKEN
here , he spotted something he hadn’t seen earlier : pens full of great masses of humans END_TOKEN
the winds blowing in from the east were growing stronger END_TOKEN
however , the parshmen guarding the pens were just standing there , as if nobody had given them orders to move END_TOKEN
the first rumblings of the highstorm had been distant , easy to miss END_TOKEN
they’d notice it soon , but that might be too late END_TOKEN
kaladin cursed , then dropped the lashing holding him upward , which made him fall in a rush END_TOKEN
he crashed to the ground , sending out a puff of glowing stormlight that expanded from him in a ring END_TOKEN
he shouted at the parshman guards END_TOKEN
they looked at him , dumbfounded END_TOKEN
kaladin summoned his blade , shoving past the parshmen and leaping up onto the pen’s low stone wall , for keeping hogs END_TOKEN
he shouted , but his voice was quickly lost in the tumult of voices END_TOKEN
he had little doubt that the voidbringers could handle a group of rioting townsfolk END_TOKEN
he sucked in more stormlight , raising himself into the air END_TOKEN
that quieted them , even drove them backward END_TOKEN
where did you shelter , he demanded in a loud voice , when the last storms came END_TOKEN
a few people near the front pointed at the large bunkers nearby END_TOKEN
for housing livestock , parshmen , and even travelers during storms END_TOKEN
could those hold an entire town’s worth of people END_TOKEN
a storm will be here soon END_TOKEN
kaladin , syl’s voice said in his mind END_TOKEN
he turned and found parshman guards approaching his wall with spears END_TOKEN
kaladin hopped down as the townspeople finally reacted , climbing the walls , which were barely chest high and slathered with smooth , hardened crem END_TOKEN
kaladin took one step toward the parshmen , then swiped his blade , separating their spearheads from the hafts END_TOKEN
the parshmen—who had barely more training than the ones he’d traveled with—stepped back in confusion END_TOKEN
do you want to fight me END_TOKEN
then see that those people don’t trample each other in their haste to get to safety , kaladin said , pointing END_TOKEN
and keep the rest of the guards from attacking them END_TOKEN
can’t you hear the thunder , and feel the wind picking up END_TOKEN
he launched himself onto the wall again , then waved for the people to move , shouting orders END_TOKEN
the parshman guards eventually decided that instead of fighting a shardbearer , they’d risk getting into trouble for doing what he said END_TOKEN
before too long , he had an entire team of them prodding the humans—often less gently than he’d have liked—toward the storm bunkers END_TOKEN
kaladin dropped down beside one of the guards , a female whose spear he’d sliced in half END_TOKEN
how did this work the last time the storm hit END_TOKEN
we mostly left the humans to themselves , she admitted END_TOKEN
we were too busy running for safety END_TOKEN
so the voidbringers hadn’t anticipated that storm’s arrival either END_TOKEN
kaladin winced , trying not to dwell on how many people had likely been lost to the impact of the stormwall END_TOKEN
do better , he said to her END_TOKEN
these people are your charge now END_TOKEN
you’ve seized the city , taken what you want END_TOKEN
if you wish to claim any kind of moral superiority , treat your captives better than they did you END_TOKEN
something large crashed into kaladin , tossing him backward into the wall with a crunch END_TOKEN
the thing had arms ; a person who grasped for his throat , trying to strangle him END_TOKEN
he kicked them off ; their eyes trailed red END_TOKEN
a blackish - violet glow—like dark stormlight—rose from the red - eyed parshman END_TOKEN
kaladin cursed and lashed himself into the air END_TOKEN
another rose nearby , leaving a faint violet glow behind , flying as easily as he did END_TOKEN
these two looked different from the one he’d seen earlier , leaner , with longer hair END_TOKEN
syl cried out in his mind , a sound like pain and surprise mixed END_TOKEN
he could only assume that someone had run to fetch these , after he had taken to the sky END_TOKEN
a few windspren zipped past kaladin , then began to dance playfully around him END_TOKEN
the sky grew dark , the stormwall thundering across the land END_TOKEN
those red - eyed parshendi chased him upward END_TOKEN
so kaladin lashed himself straight toward the storm END_TOKEN
it had worked against the assassin in white END_TOKEN
the highstorm was dangerous , but it was also something of an ally END_TOKEN
the two creatures followed , though they overshot his elevation and had to lash themselves back downward in a weird bobbing motion END_TOKEN
they reminded him of his first experimentation with his powers END_TOKEN
kaladin braced himself—holding to the sylblade , joined by four or five windspren—and crashed through the stormwall END_TOKEN
an unstable darkness swallowed him ; a darkness that was often split by lightning and broken by phantom glows END_TOKEN
winds contorted and clashed like rival armies , so irregular that kaladin was tossed by them one way , then the other END_TOKEN
it took all his skill in lashing to simply get going in the right direction END_TOKEN
he watched over his shoulder as the two red - eyed parshmen burst in END_TOKEN
their strange glow was more subdued than his own , and somehow gave off the impression of an anti - glow END_TOKEN
a darkness that clung to them END_TOKEN
they were immediately disrupted , sent spinning in the wind END_TOKEN
kaladin smiled , then was nearly crushed by a boulder tumbling through the air END_TOKEN
sheer luck saved him ; the boulder passed close enough that another few inches would have ripped off his arm END_TOKEN
kaladin lashed himself upward , soaring through the tempest toward its ceiling END_TOKEN
kaladin shouted into the churning winds END_TOKEN
kaladin stood in that strange space where he’d seen the stormfather before—a place that seemed outside of reality END_TOKEN
the ground was far beneath him , dim , slicked with rain , but barren and empty END_TOKEN
not lashed ; the air was simply solid beneath him END_TOKEN
who are you to make demands of the storm , son of honor END_TOKEN
the stormfather was a face as wide as the sky , dominating like a sunrise END_TOKEN
i know you for what you are , stormfather END_TOKEN
i am the memory of a god , the fragment that remains END_TOKEN
the soul of a storm and the mind of eternity END_TOKEN
then surely with that soul , mind , and memory , kaladin said , you can find mercy for the people below END_TOKEN
and what of the hundreds of thousands who have died in these winds before END_TOKEN
should i have had mercy for them END_TOKEN
and the waves that swallow , the fires that consume END_TOKEN
i speak only of you , and only today END_TOKEN
and the stormfather actually seemed to consider the request END_TOKEN
it is not something i can do , son of tanavast END_TOKEN
if the wind stops blowing , it is not a wind END_TOKEN
kaladin dropped back into the tempest proper , and it seemed as if no time had passed END_TOKEN
he ducked through the winds , gritting his teeth in frustration END_TOKEN
windspren accompanied him—he had two dozen now , a spinning and laughing group , each a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
he passed one of the glowing - eyed parshmen END_TOKEN
did that term refer to all whose eyes glowed END_TOKEN
the stormfather really could be more helpful , syl END_TOKEN
didn’t he claim to be your father END_TOKEN
it’s complicated , she said in his mind END_TOKEN
as people over millennia have imagined him END_TOKEN
i think what you’re doing is like asking fire to please stop being so hot END_TOKEN
kaladin zoomed down along the ground , quickly reaching the hills around revolar END_TOKEN
he had hoped to find that everyone was safe , but that was—of course—a frail hope END_TOKEN
people were scattered across the pens and the ground near the bunkers END_TOKEN
one of those bunkers still had the doors open , and a few men were trying—bless them—to gather the last people outside and carry them in END_TOKEN
they huddled against the ground , holding to the wall or outcroppings of rock END_TOKEN
kaladin could barely make them out in flashes of lightning—terrified lumps alone in the tempest END_TOKEN
he’d been powerless before them , tied to the side of a building END_TOKEN
kaladin… syl said in his mind as he dropped END_TOKEN
within the highstorm , his stormlight constantly renewed END_TOKEN
it preserved him , had saved his life a dozen times over END_TOKEN
that very power that had tried to kill him had been his salvation END_TOKEN
he hit the ground and dropped syl , then seized the form of a young father clutching a son END_TOKEN
he pulled them up , holding them secure , trying to run them toward the building END_TOKEN
nearby , another person—he couldn’t see much of them—was torn away in a gust of wind and taken by the darkness END_TOKEN
kaladin , you can’t save them all END_TOKEN
he screamed as he grabbed another person , holding her tight and walking with them END_TOKEN
they stumbled in the wind as they reached a cluster of people huddled together END_TOKEN
some two dozen or more , in the shadow of the wall around the pens END_TOKEN
kaladin pulled the three he was helping—the father , the child , the woman—over to the others END_TOKEN
you have to walk together , this way END_TOKEN
with effort—winds howling , rain pelting like daggers—he got the group moving across the stony ground , arm in arm END_TOKEN
they made good progress until a boulder crunched to the ground nearby , sending some of them huddling down in a panic END_TOKEN
the wind rose , lifting some people up ; only the clutching hands of the others kept them from blowing away END_TOKEN
kaladin blinked away tears that mingled with the rain END_TOKEN
nearby , a flash of light illuminated a man being crushed as a portion of wall ripped away and towed his body off into the storm END_TOKEN
he clung with one arm to a child , his face toward the storm and its terrible winds END_TOKEN
consumed by his pain and feelings of betrayal , kaladin surged with stormlight and flung his hand forward as if to try to push back the wind itself END_TOKEN
a hundred windspren spun in as lines of light , twisting around his arm , wrapping it like ribbons END_TOKEN
they surged with light , then exploded outward in a blinding sheet , sweeping to kaladin’s sides and parting the winds around him END_TOKEN
kaladin stood with his hand toward the tempest , and deflected it END_TOKEN
like a stone in a swift - moving river stopped the waters , he opened a pocket in the storm , creating a calm wake behind him END_TOKEN
the storm raged against him , but he held the point in a formation of windspren that spread from him like wings , diverting the storm END_TOKEN
he managed to turn his head as the storm battered him END_TOKEN
people huddled behind him , soaked , confused—surrounded by calm END_TOKEN
they found their feet , the young father taking his son back from kaladin’s leeward arm END_TOKEN
kaladin backed up with them , maintaining the windbreak END_TOKEN
this group was only some of those trapped by the winds , yet it took everything kaladin had to hold the tempest END_TOKEN
the winds seemed angry at him for his defiance END_TOKEN
all it would take was one boulder END_TOKEN
a figure with glowing red eyes landed on the field before him END_TOKEN
it advanced , but the people had finally reached the bunker END_TOKEN
kaladin sighed and released the winds , and the spren behind him scattered END_TOKEN
exhausted , he let the storm pick him up and fling him away END_TOKEN
a quick lashing gave him elevation , preventing him from being rammed into the buildings of the city END_TOKEN
wow , syl said in his mind END_TOKEN
you’ll never be able to do enough to satisfy yourself , kaladin END_TOKEN
he was past revolar in a heartbeat END_TOKEN
he turned , becoming merely another piece of debris on the winds END_TOKEN
the fused gave chase , but lagged behind , then vanished END_TOKEN
kaladin and syl pushed out of the stormwall , then rode it at the front of the storm END_TOKEN
they passed over cities , plains , mountains— never running out of stormlight , for there was a source renewing them from behind END_TOKEN
they flew for a good hour like that before a current in the winds nudged him toward the south END_TOKEN
go that way , syl said , a ribbon of light END_TOKEN
just listen to the piece of nature incarnate , okay END_TOKEN
i think father wants to apologize , in his own way END_TOKEN
kaladin growled , but allowed the winds to channel him in a specific direction END_TOKEN
he flew this way for hours , lost in the sounds of the tempest , until finally he settled down—half of his own volition , half because of the pressing winds END_TOKEN
the storm passed—leaving him in the middle of a large , open field of rock END_TOKEN
the plateau in front of the tower city of urithiru END_TOKEN
for i , of all people , have changed END_TOKEN
shallan settled in sebarial’s sitting room END_TOKEN
it was a strangely shaped stone chamber with a loft above—he sometimes put musicians there—and a shallow cavity in the floor , which he kept saying he was going to fill with water and fish END_TOKEN
she was fairly certain he made claims like that just to annoy dalinar with his supposed extravagance END_TOKEN
for now , they’d covered the hole with some boards , and sebarial would periodically warn people not to step on them END_TOKEN
the rest of the room was decorated lavishly END_TOKEN
she was pretty sure she’d seen those tapestries in a monastery in dalinar’s warcamp , and they were matched by luxurious furniture , golden lamps , and ceramics END_TOKEN
and a bunch of splintery boards covering a pit END_TOKEN
then—curled up on a sofa with blankets heaped over her—she gladly accepted a cup of steaming citrus tea from palona END_TOKEN
she still hadn’t been able to rid herself of the lingering chill she’d felt since her encounter with re - shephir a few hours back END_TOKEN
is there anything else i can get you END_TOKEN
shallan shook her head , so the herdazian woman settled herself on a sofa nearby , holding another cup of tea END_TOKEN
shallan sipped , glad for the company END_TOKEN
adolin had wanted her to sleep , but the last thing she wanted was to be alone END_TOKEN
he’d handed her over to palona’s care , then stayed with dalinar and navani to answer their further questions END_TOKEN
she’d touched the storming midnight mother END_TOKEN
a name from ancient lore , one of the unmade , princes of the voidbringers END_TOKEN
people sang about re - shephir in poetry and epics , describing her as a dark , beautiful figure END_TOKEN
paintings depicted her as a black - clad woman with red eyes and a sultry gaze END_TOKEN
that seemed to exemplify how little they really remembered about these things END_TOKEN
it wasn’t like the stories , shallan whispered END_TOKEN
re - shephir is a spren END_TOKEN
a vast , terrible spren who wants so desperately to understand us END_TOKEN
so she kills us , imitating our violence END_TOKEN
there was a deeper mystery beyond that , a wisp of something she’d glimpsed while intertwined with re - shephir END_TOKEN
it made shallan wonder if this spren wasn’t merely trying to understand humankind , but rather searching for something it itself had lost END_TOKEN
had this creature—in distant , distant time beyond memory—once been human END_TOKEN
at shallan’s first report , navani had set her scholars searching for information , but their access to books here was still limited END_TOKEN
even with access to the palanaeum , shallan wasn’t optimistic END_TOKEN
jasnah had hunted for years to find urithiru , and even then most of what she’d discovered had been unreliable END_TOKEN
it had simply been too many years END_TOKEN
to think it was here , all this time , palona said END_TOKEN
she was captive , shallan whispered END_TOKEN
she eventually escaped , but that was centuries ago END_TOKEN
she has been waiting here ever since END_TOKEN
well , we should find where the others are held , and make sure they don’t get out END_TOKEN
i don’t know if the others were ever captured END_TOKEN
she’d felt isolation and loneliness from re - shephir , a sense of being torn away while the others escaped END_TOKEN
they’re out there , and always have been , shallan said END_TOKEN
she felt exhausted , and her eyes were drooping in direct defiance of her insistence to adolin that she was not that kind of tired END_TOKEN
surely we’d have discovered them by now END_TOKEN
i don’t know , shallan said END_TOKEN
they’ll… they’ll just be normal to us END_TOKEN
the way things have always been END_TOKEN
she yawned , then nodded absently as palona continued talking , her comments degenerating into praise of shallan for acting as she had END_TOKEN
adolin had been the same way , which she hadn’t minded , and dalinar had been downright nice to her—instead of being his usual stern rock of a human being END_TOKEN
she didn’t tell them how near she’d come to breaking , and how terrified she was that she might someday meet that creature again END_TOKEN
but… maybe she did deserve some acclaim END_TOKEN
she’d been a child when she’d left her home , seeking salvation for her family END_TOKEN
for the first time since that day on the ship , watching jah keved fade behind her , she felt like she actually might have a handle on all of this END_TOKEN
like she might have found some stability in her life , some control over herself and her surroundings END_TOKEN
remarkably , she kind of felt like an adult END_TOKEN
she smiled and snuggled into her blankets , drinking her tea and—for the moment—putting out of her mind that basically an entire troop of soldiers had seen her with her glove off END_TOKEN
she was kind of an adult END_TOKEN
she could deal with a little embarrassment END_TOKEN
in fact , she was increasingly certain that between shallan , veil , and radiant , she could deal with anything life could throw at her END_TOKEN
a disturbance outside made her sit up , though it didn’t sound dangerous END_TOKEN
some chatter , a few boisterous exclamations END_TOKEN
she wasn’t terribly surprised when adolin stepped in , bowed to palona—he did have nice manners— and jogged over to her , his uniform still rumpled from having worn shardplate over it END_TOKEN
well , someone just arrived at the tower END_TOKEN
sebarial passed the news ; the bridgeboy is back END_TOKEN
no , that’s not what i’m talking about END_TOKEN
adolin searched for words as voices approached , and several other people stepped into the room END_TOKEN
at their head was jasnah kholin END_TOKEN
